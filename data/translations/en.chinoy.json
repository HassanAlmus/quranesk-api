    "16. These are people who exchanged misguidance for guidance, which transaction did not prove beneficial and they were not guided in adopting this course; as purchase of misguidance leads to loss of reason (i.e. faith) main capital.",
    "17. Their example resembles those who lit up fire when it illuminates surroundings, God removes (this artificial) light and leaves them in their (original) darkness when they cannot see.",
    "18. They are deaf (to Truth), dumb (in maintaining truth) and blind (in realizing signs of truth) and they will not retreat (from misguidance).",
    "19. Or their example is alike (those taken up) in heavy downpour of Heavenly (rainfall) wherein is darkness, thunder, and lightening, out of fear of death, they thrust their fingers into their ears; God has gained round infidels.",
    "20. Lightening is just at the point of dazzling their eyes when it lightens about them, they walk therein; when darkness overtakes them they stand over. If God wished, He could have (otherwise) deprived them of (their power of) hearing and sight. Verily, God is Omnipotent.",
    "21. Oh you (addressed to all those men of matured age), pray unto your Providence, He who created you and those before you (i.e. Universal creator sole and one), certainly (no wonder) you become God-fearing, i.e. Chaste.",

Verily, God does not refrain from exemplifying a mosquito or a meaner one than this, and those who have embraced faith know that (exemplification) from their Providence is a fact, and those who have denied say what does God mean thereby? Most are guided thereby and most go astray at this and none but the disobedient are led astray.",

    "29. It is He who created everything on Earth and then attended to creating sky of which He produced seven. He is alone acquainted with everything (Omniscient).",
    "30. Oh you Prophet, recall when the Providence said unto angels which He shall (ever) be appointing His representative on Earth. They said, “Even though they be fanning dissension and causing bloodshed, while we pray unto You.”",
    "31. And Adam was taught knowledge of all things (in the presence of angels) and questions on the same were put before angels and He said, “If you are justified in your claim, name what these are?”",
    "32. Angels importunately prayed unto God, “Grand is Your Glory” and we bear no knowledge beyond what we are taught. Verily, “You are All-knowing.”",
    "33. Then he commanded Adam to point to them their names (with their properties). When Adam taught them the knowledge of things, God addressed them, “Did not I remark I have knowledge of the hidden on earth and in the heavens and also I know what you expose and impose.",
    "34. Recall when I commanded angels to kneel down before Adam, all knelt down except “Iblis” (arch-angel) who refused and turned away and proved himself among the infidels.",
    "35. And We told Adam to abide in Paradise with his wife and eat thereof what they chose not to approach that tree lest they might become disobedient.",
    "36. The Satan planned to expel them and succeeded in removing them from where they were and We commanded them to get down “Where you will be inimical to one another and you will have sojourn on Earth with property for the time being.”",
    "37. Then Adam received some intercessory prayers, upon utterance of which their penance was admitted by God. Verily He is might at admission of penance and might at forgiving sins.",
    "38. We commanded “You will get down (on Earth) and when you shall receive guidance from ‘Me’ (alone).” Those who shall follow it will have no fear of future nor be sorry for the past (sins).",

    "49. Remember when We saved you from the clutches of the Pharaoh’s followers, who were tormenting you in various ways and were sparing your daughters and wherein there was a great trial from your Providence.",
    "50. And remember when We paved a way for you in the sea and saved you and drowned in your presence the followers of Pharaoh.",
    "51. And remember when We contracted a promise from Moses of 40 nights, then you became disobedient in his absence by worshipping a calf.",
    "52. Even then We forgave you so you may be grateful to Us.",
    "53. Remember when We endowed upon Moses Text and Distinctive test (to distinguish truth from falsehood) so you may adopt the right path.",
    "54. Remember when Moses told his sect, “Oh you followers, you have disobeyed by worshipping a calf, do penance in the presence of your Creator and kill one another , this is just fair for you in the eyes of your creator, then “He” accepted penance and showering grace.",
    "55. Remember when you told Moses, “We shall never put faith in God until we see Him,” (with our physical eyes) you saw lightening falling on you.",
    "56. Then We enlivened you, after your death, so you may be grateful.",
    "57. And “We” cast clouds over your heads as a shade and sent you heavenly fish (manna and salva) and (We commanded) to eat pure of our provision, in spite of it, they did not become grateful. They did no harm to Us, rather they were putting themselves to destruction.",
    "58. And when We commanded them to go to the village and eat thereof what they liked and enter kneeling down at the gate and calling “Hitta” while entering. We shall forgive their sins and shall We soon raise the virtuous.",
    "59. But the disobedient exchanged what We dictated with what they liked. Therefore, We cast upon them Heavenly disaster in proportion to their disobedience.",
    "60. When Moses prayed to “Us” for water for his sect “We” commanded to strike his rod on the rock, upon which gushed out 12 streams. When everyone knew his channel, eat and drink of Divine provision and do not move about on Earth, causing dissentions.",
    "61. When you told Moses, “We shall not be content on one food, pray to your Providence to produce from Earth vegetables, fruits, garlic, date and onions. Moses said, “What, are you exchanging what is superior gift to trifling? If so, get down to the town and you will have your requisition.” Disgrace was cast on them and poverty and plague with Divine wrath followed. This was due to their infidelity to God’s couplets and murdering His messengers without any just cause. Thus they sinned and were transgressors.",
    "62. Verily, those who embraced faith, the Jews and the Christians and Sabians, whoever shall believe in God and in the Day of Judgment and act virtuously shall have their reward before their Providence without having fear in future and grief.",
    "63. Remember when “We” exacted a promise from you and raised Mount Sina over your head to hold fast by Our Commands given to you, reminding therein to make you virtuous.",
    "64. After which you turned away, and had it not been for “Divine Mercy and Grace” on you, you would have been ruined.",
    "65. Verily, you know the people who transgressed ordinance of Holy Sabbath, when We ordered them to be disgraceful monkeys.",
    "66. And this punishment we made a guide between them and future generations and an advice for the virtuous (so they may not violate restrictions on Friday).",
    "67. Remember when Moses told his sect, “God has commanded to sacrifice a cow among the ignorant.",
    "68. Upon which they requested Moses to pray to His Providence to describe upon which Moses said the cow should",
    "69. be neither young nor old but in between; carry out orders eye.",
    "70. Upon which, they requested Moses to pray to his Providence to further specify it, as the cow had created doubt in them and verily, “Shall we, God willing, be guided.”",
    "71. He said, “It should be neither working on the field, nor ploughing and be spotless.” They said, “There it is now! You have hit on the right mark.” They sacrificed it although it was not expected of them.",
    "72. After killing a person you disagreed (as to the person who killed him) and God wanted to disclose what you wanted to hide.",
    "73. Thereupon We commanded to take a piece of (sacrificed) cow’s flesh and touch it to the corpse. Thus God enlivens the dead and indicates to you miracles so you may appreciate (His glory).",
    "74. Then your hearts hardened (blinded) to realize actual facts although they were stones, rather harder than them, although some of them (stones) are such from which ooze out springs. Some of them burst out letting out water, some of them precipitate out of Divine Awe, and God is not unaware of your actions.",
    "75. Do you wish they should believe in you to Divine commands and after realizing (significance although there is a group among them who listens thereto) tampers with them intentionally?",
    "76. And when they meet the faithful they said, “We have embraced faith” and when they meet one another in privacy they say, ”What! Do you disclose those facts which are revealed unto you by God (regarding tidings of the Prophet’s coming) so they may advance these arguments before God against you: do you not have such sense?”",
    "77. Do not they know God knows what they impose and expose.",
    "78. Some of them are so illiterate they do not understand the text (except tidings or threats) held out therein, they are none but simply guessing (as simple Shia’s faith on Hussain) without his Marefath who sacrificed self and family to gain Divine Will.",
    "79. Therefore, hell is for those who record the text of their own making, them they declare to be divine revelation so as to profit by it at a trifle interest. Therefore, hell is destined for them for this record of their own and hell is for them what they have earned.",
    "80. And they said “Hellish fire shall not touch them but for a little while.” You tell them, “Have you a written promise from God on the authority of which you make a statement about God what you do not know?”",
    "81 Rather, those who commit such a (major) sin (from which they cannot be extricated) is one who is a member of hell wherein they shall ever be remain.",
    "82. Those who believe (in God, Prophet, and Eternity) and act virtuously (on this basis) are members of paradise wherein they shall ever abide.",
    "83. Remember when We exacted a promise from Bani Israel (Jews), “Do not pray unto anybody except “Me” as (only) God, and do act virtuously towards (a) Parent (b) with relations and (c) orphans and (d) the helpless and (e) talk courteously with people (this is the major crusade, be steadfast (g) at timely prayers and (h) payment of tithe. . But from which you turned away, barring few among you and are disobedient.",
    "84. And remember the promise, “We” exacted not to shed blood of any amongst you, nor expel any of them from you native land to which you agreed and are an evidence.",
    "85. Then you are those very people, killing one another and driving out a group amongst you from the native land and conspiring with one another in commission of sins and transgressing of Divine commands, and when they came as prisoners to you, you demand ransom whereas it is unlawful to you. What! Do you believe in part of the text and deny the rest. Those whoso act amongst you shall be meted out in disgrace in this world and driven to an intense punishment on the Day of Reckoning. God is not unaware of your actions.",
    "86. These are the very people who have purchased transitory world for eternity; neither will their punishment be mitigated nor will they be assisted.",
    "87. Verily, We revealed unto Moses the text and thereafter sent a succession of Prophets and endowed on Jesus, son of Mary, miracles and reinforced him with Holy Ghost. What! When all the Prophets came with what your passions did not like, you turned away, some of you falsifying and others by slaying them.",
    "88. And they said their hearts were masked, rather God had cursed and few of them (are susceptible), i.e. who sincerely do penance.",
    "89. And when the Text (Qur’an-i-Sharif by the Prophet) was revealed to them from God, confirming the one, which they had and regarding which (Qur’an-i-Sharif and the Prophet) they were thinking of superseding the infidels by putting faith into it and the Prophet, and when he came they recognized (from the signs they had in the Text) they refused to believe in him on account of which God cursed the infidels.",
    "90. Bad it was, the exchanged faith for infidelity, for their own soul, and this rebellion was due to what God had revealed unto His creatures of (Ismail’s descent and not of Isaac’s descent, like Moses and Jesus) His choice out of His grace. They were enveloped with Divine wrath and for infidels is disgraceful punishment.",
    "91. When they were asked to embrace faith in what God had revealed, they replied, “We would believe in what God had revealed to us (i.e. the Torah)” and deny the rest, although the rest was true confirming the one they had. Tell them, “Why did you slay so many (of God’s) messengers before this if you are really faithful?”",
    "92. Verily, came Moses to you with miracles and you took to calf worship in his absence and thereby proved yourselves disobedient.",
    "93. Remember when We exacted a promise from you, raising Mount Sinai over you to hold fast by what is revealed unto you and listen thereto. They said, “We heard and disobeyed” because the love of the calf (embellished in gold) had got the upper hand into their hearts due to their infidelity. Say (oh you Prophet) bad it is “if your faith so ordains” if you claim to be faithful.",
    "94. Say, “If eternity is reserved for you alone, desire death, (to secure it immediately) if you are true in your claim.”",
    "95. They shall never desire death because of their evil deeds of the past, and God knows the disobedient",
    "96. And you will find them highly greedy of life of this world, and of associators, each one of them would like to live a thousand years, although this will not anyway mitigate their punishment and God is seeing their actions (whom they are ignoring, while sinning, for the time being).",
    "97. Tell them, “Those who are inimical to the Holy Ghost, for he reveals unto they hearts, under Divine commands, confirming what has preceded it and is guidance and tidings for the faithful (is inimical to God).",
    "98. To those who are inimical to God, His angels, His Prophets, Holy Ghost and Michael, verily God is inimical.",
    "99. And verily, “We” revealed unto you open couplets which are denied by none but the disobedient.",
    "100. And when they contracted promise, a group among them breached it, rather most of them do not believe it.",
    "101. And when a prophet came from God confirming what was with them a group of revealed religion discarded him throwing God’s book behind their backs, as if they did not know.",
    "102. They followed the devils in Solomon’s kingdom, although Solomon was not an infidel, but the devils who taught magic to men and what was revealed to angels “Harut and Marut” of Babul. They (Harut and Marut) did not teach anybody before telling them, they were a trial for them, which they should not deny. But they learned that part of it, which created disaffection between husband and wife and they were not to harm anybody thereby except under Divine will. They learned what was ruinous to their own cause, without doing any good to them and they knew it very well what they were purchasing had no share for them in eternity. Bad it was, they purchased for themselves, would they had known it.",
    "103. Whereas, had they believed and feared God they would have reaped the better reward from God, would they had known it.",
    "104. Oh you faithful, do not say Ra‘ina but say Unzurna, i.e. give us hearing, and for infidels there is intense punishment.",
    "105. Men of revealed religions and associators do not like any good to come to you from your Providence, whereas God specifies His grace to which so ever He likes. And He is master of mighty grace.",
    "106. We do not cancel any of Our commandments or make you forget it unless We replace it with better or of equal value or merit. Do you not know God is Omnipotent?",
    "107. Do you not know God is proprietor of the Heavens and Earth, there is none but He to support and help you.",
    "108. What! Do they think of asking you what they asked Moses before you? Those who change faith with infidelity are misguided.",
    "109. Most People of revealed religions desire to render you infidel after your embracing faith and this is jealousy due to perverted sense. When facts have been exposed to them, forgive them and forbear until divine commands (re-crusade) come to you. Verily, God is Omnipotent.",
    "110. Pray and pay the tithe and what you send ahead for you, shall you receive better thereof from God. God is All-seeing your deeds.",
    "111. They said, “None but Jews and Christians shall enter paradise.” These are their desires. Tell them to bring their arguments (in defence of their statement) if they are true.",
    "112. Rather, those who prepare the self to serve God for the sake of God and is faithful has their rewards before their Providence without fear of the future or grief of the past.",
    "113. And the Jews said the “Christians are nowhere” and the Christians retorted similarly the Jews, though both are reading the Text. Similarly said those without knowledge (e.g. Shia Sunnis) and God shall decide their difference on reckoning day.",
    "114. Who can be greater tyrant than one who prevents people from entering the mosque where God is being remembered and attempt at destroying it? These are persons who should enter it with dread in them, for them is disgrace in this world and intense punishment in eternity.",
    "115. East and West are God’s, wherefore you turn either way (for Namaz-e-nafila i.e. auxiliary prayers) you choose. Verily, God is Omniscient.",
    "116. And they said, “God adopted a son (in Jesus),” (pure is He of any need), rather is everything of the heavens and earth for Him, all supplicate him.",
    "117. Creator of the Heavens and the Earth, whenever He wills by a command of “Be,” i.e. present, it is present there.",
    "118. The ignorant say “Why does He not talk, or send a miracle to us.” Similarly said prior to them people like minded, expressly We declare to convince the faithful.",
    "119. Certainly We sent you an evangelist and warner and thou shall not be questioned regarding those condemned to Hell.",
    "120. And the Christians and Jews shall never be pleased with you until you follow their faith. Say,”Verily, God’s guidance is the true guidance.” And if you follow their passion knowingly, after guidance has come to you (i.e. follow the sinful against the immaculate) there shall be none to support or help you against God.",
    "121. Those whom We revealed the Text, read it as it has to be read (i.e. reflect its commands and refrain from forbidden) those are the persons who have faith in it, and others who deny it reading similarly are to suffer (in eternity).",
    "122. Oh you Jews, remember My bounties which I have endowed upon you and I exalted you over the world.",
    "123. Fear the day (parting day) when none will compensate nor any substitute accepted nor any intercession admitted nor any assistance be of avail.",
    "124. When We tried Abraham with certain questions which he solved successfully. We said, “I am going to make you Representative on Earth.” He prayed, “Will there be any successor from my family.” God said, “The disobedient shall not get an access thereto.”",
    "125. And We made the house (Mecca) a resort for reward to people and refuge (to boot), and take Abraham’s place of work for your prayers and commanded Abraham and Ismael to purify it, purify it for those going round, stopping, prostrating on knees and heel, toes.",
    "126. And recall when Abraham prayed to Us to keep it (Holy sanctuary of Mecca) safe (against enemies) and provide its residents with provisions and those who shall, amongst them, believe in God and the Day of Reckoning. God said, “Those who shall deny shall We temporarily endow on them little of it and then direct them to punishment of hell which is a horrible destination.”",
    "127. Recall when Abraham with his son was raising the foundation of the house, he prayed for acceptance of his labour adding You are all-hearing and knowing.",
    "128. My providence make us obedient to You and from my family a section obedient to You and teach us form of worship accepting our penance for verily You are merciful, accepting penance.",
    "129. My providence, “Raise amongst them a Prophet, who shall read out to them Your couplets teaching them of the Text and the Philosophy (therein) and purifying them for You are mighty and wise.”",
    "130. And who will turn away from faith of Abraham except those who degrade themselves. Verily, We have chosen him on Earth and he is of the virtuous in Eternity.",
    "131. Recall when their Providence addressed them to supplicate. They said, “I supplicate Providence of the worlds.”",
    "132. And Abraham and Jacob willed their sons, “Oh my sons, God selected you to propagate His faith and do not die until you are Muslims.",
    "133. Oh sons of Jacob, were you present at his deathbed when he questioned his sons as to whom they would worship after him? They said, “We shall worship your God, God of your forefathers, Abraham, Ismael, and Isaac as God the monos and to Him shall we resign.”",
    "134. These were the sects who passed to whom is reward of their deeds and to you shall be likewise and you shall not be questioned about their deeds.",
    "135. But they said “Be Jews or Christians to get guidance.” Tell them in reply “Rather Abraham’s faith is direct and he was not amongst associators.”",
    "136. Tell them “We have believed unto God and what is revealed unto Abraham, Ismael, Isaac, Jacob, and his children and to Moses and Jesus and to the Prophets from their Providence making no difference amongst any of them and we have resigned unto Him.",
    "137. If they (Christians and Jews) believe as you believe (as aforesaid) then (know) they are guided and if they turn back (know) definitely they are nothing but infidels. God shall suffice you (against their intrigues) and He is all hearing and knowing.",
    "138. This is God’s covenant, i.e. Islam, and what can be better than Divine covenant Islam, i.e. God’s religion and we supplicate Him.",
    "139. Tell, are you disputing with us regarding God, who is Providence of us and you (if so) to us, is consequence of our deeds and to you likewise and we are sincere devotees to Him as Muslims.",
    "140. What! Do you say Abraham, Ismael, Isaac, and Jacob and his children were Jews or Christians. Say, “Do you know better than God?” And who can be a greater tyrant than one who hides Divine Evidence with him and God is not indifferent to your deeds.",
    "141. Those were the persons which are gone. To them is reward of their deeds and to you likewise and you shall not be questioned about their deeds.",
    "142. Shortly the foolish will say, what made them turn from the (original) Qibla where he was directing them (in prayers). Say east and west are of God. He guides whomever He likes on the right path.",
    "143. Thus we made you (Immaculates) a just section to witness on actions of humans and the Prophet to testify your evidence, and We did not make the original Qibla to which you were directing except to find out who followed the prophet and those who turned away from him, although it is hard (to follow the Prophet) except whom God befits for guidance and God does not want to destroy your faith. Verily, He is very considerate and Merciful towards humans.",
    "144. Verily, He saw turning your face to the Heavens and surely shall He turn you to the Qibla you desire. So you turn your face towards the Holy Mosque, and wherever shall you be, shall you direct towards the mosque (while praying in obligatory prayers) and those who are given Divine knowledge, know they are rightly (duly appointed by his Providence) and God is not indifferent to your action.",
    "145. And if you bring to (those Jews and Christians) people of revealed religions, all (possible) miracles (or arguments) they will not adopt your Qibla and some of them, (i.e. Christians of Palestine east) and should you follow their passion after facts have been revealed to you, you shall be among the disobedient.",
    "146. Those who have revealed religions recognize you as they do their children, but a group among them hide facts and in spite of knowledge.",
    "147. Truth (Prophet Mohammad) has come already from your Providence, be not (oh you Muslims) among the suspects.",
    "148. And for every direction Qibla varies where they have to direct. You try to exceed in virtues wherever you shall be God shall assemble you, as He is Omnipotent.",
    "149. And wherever you go direct your face to the Holy Mosque for, i.e. the fight command from your providence and God is not different to your actions.",
    "150. And wherever you go have your face to the Qibla and wherever you be you should face the Qibla in prayers so you may be a witness to them (who do not face Qibla), except those who are disobedient (allege falsely) you are associate, directing yourself to Qibla of associators), do not fear them but fear Me. I shall complete My bounties for your guidance.",
    "151. Just as We sent a prophet amongst you who reads out to you Our commands and purifies you by thus saving you from commission of sins (i.e. prevents you from vices) and raising your stage of guidance higher than the past and teaches you the text and the philosophy thereof acquaints you with what you do not know.",
    "152. Thus you remember Me so I may count you (among the rememberers) penitents and worshippers thank Me and do not be ungrateful (so I may enhance My Bounties upon you).",
    "153. Oh you faithful, pray help with fast and prayers. Verily God is with the patient.",
    "154. Do not say martyrs are dead, they are alive of which you are not aware.",
    "155. And surely shall We test you touching, (1) fear, (2) hunger, (3) loss in property, (4) life, and (5) children, and give tidings to the patient,",
    "156. who, when calamity falls on them say, verily we are (created to court everything) for God and certainly to Him shall we return.",

    "81. Had they believed in God and Prophet, and what was revealed unto them, they would not have befriended them, but many of them are vicious.",
    "82. You will certainly find dead enemies of the faithful in Jews and Associators, and you will find from them greater friends to the faithful who claim to be Christian. For this reason some of them are learned and others are Monks, and they are not proud (because pride causes hatred and leads to loss of sound reasoning).",
    "83. When they hear what is revealed unto the Prophet, you see tears running down from their eyes because they have recognized truth and pray, “Oh our Providence, we have embraced Faith, and write down us among the testifiers”",
    "84. What is up with us that we should not believe in God when Truth has come to us and we desire our Providence to include us among the virtuous.",
    "85. So God, in lieu of their prayers, shall endow upon them Paradise, below which flow streams, wherein shall they ever abide. Such is the reward of the sincerely virtuous.",
    "86. And those who became infidels and falsified our Lights (i.e. in person of Our Guide are of Hell).",
    "87. Oh you faithful, do not illegalize what God has legalized for you, and do not transgress, verily God does not approve of transgressors.",
    "88. And eat of lawful and pure endowed upon you by God and fear God, in whom you have put faith.",
    "89. God shall not hold you up for your unintentional oaths, but rather those committed intentionally. Expatiation whereof is feeding ten needy of ordinary meals, which are being given to your family or dressing ten of them who are naked, or enfranchising a single slave, and those who cannot afford any of these should observe fast for three successive days. This is expatiation of your oaths. Thus openly does God describe His Commands to you so you be grateful.",
    "90. Oh you faithful, wine, gambling (under staking and sacrifices in the name of idols, and distribution under archery are nothing but impure acts of the devil. Avoid them so you may attain salvation.",
    "91. Devil’s sole intention is to create enmity, malice, among you by means of wine and gambling and prevent you from Divine remembrance (of His Commands in regulation of your life). Will you now desist from them?",
    "92. Obey God and prophet and keep on fearing, and if you turn away, know the Prophet’s mere duty is to transmit message distinctly.",
    "93. There is no accounting from them who embrace faith act righteously in their having enjoyed food and clothing when they kept on fearing and for those who embraced faith, acted virtuously and adopted piety in their daily life, nor is it objectionable for those who embraced faith and again attended to piety and developed it into obligation, God befriends the obliging.",
    "95. Oh you faithful, God shall try you certainly, on shooting when you shoot with hand, and arrow, so as to discover who is afraid of Him Unseen, and those who transgress it, shall have intense punishment.",
    "95. Oh you faithful, do not shoot while you are in the forbidden stage during pilgrimage. Those who kill intentionally, punishment thereof is like an animal shot, awarded by a prophet or his legal successor of y our time, and this sacrifice shall be sent to the holy sanctuary at Mecca or be expatiated by feeding the needy or fasting equal number of days, so you may taste the punishment of your deed. God has overlooked the past; those who repeat it, God shall avenge them (by sending them to Hell) as He is Mighty at everything.",
    "96. Sea fishing is legalized for you, and eating thereof for your benefit and of your company, and so long as you are in the forbidden stage, during pilgrimage land hunting is unlawful for you. Fear God before whom you shall assembled.",
    "97. God has made a holy sanctuary of Ka‘ba a source of life for humans on Earth. Similarly, holy months, sacrifice, and animals round necks of which are belts for sacrifice, so you may know verily God knows what is in Heaven and earth and God is omniscient.",
    "98. Know God is verily mighty at punishment and God is forgiving and merciful.",
    "99. There is no obligation of Prophet beyond transmission of message. God knows what you expose and hide.",
    "100. Say, “The impure and pure are not alike although the excess of impure may astonish you, fear God oh you sensible people so you attain salvation.”",
    "101. Oh you faithful do not ask about those things which, if only described, you will find hard to comply with , and if you ask during revelation, they will be exposed to you. God forgave them, He is highly forgiving and forbearing.",
    "102. Certainly prior to you, people similarly asked and became infidels (being unable to discharge).",
    "103. God has not classified and issued different commands for camels and goats, e.g. Baheera, Sayeba, Vaseela, Ham, the infidels are libelling God, when most of them do not understand.",
    "104. What they have found with their forefathers shall suffice them. Well, if they are ignorant and misguided, will it then be a sufficient justification for them?",
    "105. Oh you faithful, it is necessary to guard you life. When you are guided, let not the misguided injure you; to God shall be reversion of all when He will acquaint you, on what you made a division.",
    "106. Oh you faithful, during the deathbed of any of you, your will should be testified by two just persons among you, or if you are on tour and calamity of death falls on you, it may be attested by two foreigners. Hold them over until afternoon prayers, and let them make a statement on oath, if you have doubt. “We shall not sell Our testimony for anything, be they our relation, and we shall not hide true evidence, if we did so, we shall be sinful.”",
    "107. And then if it is known to inheritors of the deceased, they have been liable, on account of false evidence, two witnesses be raised from among the parties whose rights have been overlooked, on account of such false witnesses and they should make a statement on oath, “Our evidence is comparatively more reliable than theirs and we are not transgressors anyway; if so, we shall be liable.”",
    "108. This practice is more suitable to arrive at a true evidence and create fear in them, lest their oath be set aside as their predecessor and fear God and keep on hearing His Commands and God does not guide the disobedient.",
    "109. The day God shall assemble Prophets and ask how they were responded to their call (of inviting people to the right path); they will reply, “We do not know, You are Knower of secrets.",
    "110. Recall when God shall address, “Oh you Jesus, son of Mary, recollect My bounties on you and on your mother. I supported your cause with Gabriel when you talked evenly with people in childhood and youth and I trained you in Divine philosophy, Law, torah, and Bible, and then you were moulding out of Earth a bird like figure, under My sanction and blowing therein with My consent, it became a living bird, and you were curing with My sanction natural blind and lepers and enlivening the dead with My sanction and I save you from injury of Jews when you appeared before them with open miracles. The infidels among them said, ‘This is nothing but an open magic.’”",
    "111. And when I inspired the fishermen to embrace faith in Me and My prophet, they said we have embraced faith and bear witness we supplicate.",
    "112. And recollect when fishermen said, “Oh you Jesus, son of Mary, is it possible for your Providence to send from Heaven full of food.” You said, “Fear God if you are faithful.”",
    "113. They said, “We desire to eat of it, so we be assured and we come to know you said the truth and be witness thereto.”",
    "114. Upon which Jesus prayed, “Oh my God, my Providence, endow on us a table full of meals from Heaven which becomes for us and our successors a festival and a miracle from You, grant us provision and You are best at providing.",
    "115. God said, “Verily shall I endow it on you. Those who among you becomes an infidel thereafter, shall be punished most intensely of all in the world.",
    "116. Recollect when God shall address, “Oh you Jesus, son of Mary, did you ask me to hold you and your mother gods barring the True God?” He will say, “Pure is Your nature what is up with me in which I should speak what I have no right to commit. If I did, You would know as You do know what is secret in my heart and I do not know what is Yours. You are knower of secrets of secrets.",
    "117. I did not say anything to them expect what You commanded, i.e. worship God, my Providence and Your Providence and I am a witness for the period I remained with them, and You did finish my period of stay with them. You did remain their Guard and You are a witness on all events.",
    "118. If you do punish them, they are Your creatures, and if You do forgive them verily, You are Might and Wise.",
    "119. When God will say, “This Reckoning Day will benefit the true for their truth, for them is Paradise below which flow streams, wherein shall they ever abide, God being pleased with them and they will be pleased with Him, and this is a mighty achievement.",
    "120. For God is the Kingdom of the Heavens and the Earth and in between and He is Omnipotent."

    "8. And they say, “Why has no angels come to the Prophet?” Had We sent an angel, the whole affair would have been settled and they would not have got any opportunity for righteous act.",
    "9. Had We sent an angel, We would have sent him in the habit of man and dressed him as you do.",

Say, it is of God alone, Who made it obligatory on Himself to be Merciful (by sending you the Prophet, acquainting you with His sole sovereignty, giving you time to repent and worship Him). There is no doubt about His assembling you all on Reckoning Day. Those who have put self to loss, shall not embrace faith.",

Say, “God is a witness between me and you and this text is revealed unto me to warn you therewith and those accessible to it (through my genuine successor). What? Do you testify of any associating with God?” Say, “I testify there is none else except God alone, and I am away from what you associate.”",

    "25. And among them there are some who hear you and We have thrown a veil over their hearts, so they may not understand and We have made their ears hard of hearing. So if they see every miracle, shall they not believe in it until when they come to you, they will start disputing and the infidels will say, this is nothing but tales of old.",
    "26. And they prevent others from assisting you and desist themselves; they are only destroying themselves and are not aware.",
    "27. If you see when they will be made to stand close to Hell, they will desire, “Would we were allowed to revert to the world, would we had not falsified our Divine Lights and we had been faithful.",
    "28. Rather, what they hid (of their hypocrisy before) would be exposed to them, and if they even were reverted they would take to what they were forbidden.",
    "29. They said, “Whatever is really is the life in this physical (and nothing beyond) world and we are not going to be raised alive.”",
    "30. Would you have seen them standing before their Creator, Who will question, “If Reckoning Day is not a fact?” They would say, yes our Creator, when they will be asked to taste the punishment they were denying.",
    "31 Verily they are in loss who have falsified facing the Providence. When Judgment Day shall overtake them suddenly they will grieve as to how much they belittled it, and they would be bearing load of their sins on their back; how dreadful it is very bearing.",
    "32. And this worldly (physical) life is nothing but play and sport, and eternal life is better for the God fearing. Do you not understand so much?",

    "35. If their resistance to faith is hard upon you, if you can find a hole on Earth or a ladder to heaven to bring miracles, (do so). And if God will, He would have forced guidance on all and so you are not among the ignorant (this refers to public).",

    "39. Those who have falsified Our signs (in writing or person of our Divine Lights) they are deaf, mute, and in darkness of misguidance.

    "53. And thus have We tested some by others so they (Ansar and Quraish) say, “Are these people whom God has Favoured? What does not God discern who is grateful?”",
    "54. And when these (companions of Sufha) who have believed in Divine Lights, come to you, great them with salutation (and give tidings), saying, “Your Providence has adopted mercy and obligatory function on Self.” So if any of you commits in error (through ignorance) and thus repents thereafter and reforms self, certainly, God is forgiving and merciful.",

Neither does a germ take birth in the womb of a mother nor a pre-mature birth or of mature birth but has it be preserved on record.",

    "61. He is all controlling and sends on angels to guard until death comes to you, when Our angels carry away his soul without any concession therein",
    "62. when they will be directed to the real God. Mind you, He has the power and is quickest at taking account.",
    "63. Say, “Who saves you from darkness of land and sea and whom you importunately and secretly pray unto.” If He gave you salvation therefrom you would certainly be grateful to Him.",

    "65. Say, “He is mighty enough to send you punishment from above your head (fire and brim stones from Heaven) or below your foot (earthquake) or set you one against another (global war) so as to taste the result of mutual hatred. Just imagine how We variously express Our Commands so you may realize.”",
    "66. Your tribe falsified the Text (punishment, etc.) although it is true. Say, “I am not your guard (to force on you my conviction) for everything there is a fixed period and you will come to know later on.",
    "67. for everything there is a fixed period and you will come to know later on.”",
    "68. When you see people engaged in ridiculing and falsifying Our Couplets, you turn away from them until they change the subject topic, and if the evil makes you forget, on recollection, do not keep company with them.",
    "69. Do not sit where Divine Lights are being disrespected or even a Muslim being backbitten. For the pious, they have not to render any account on behalf of tyrants, but to remind them so they may take a warning.",
    "70. Leave them aside who have taken their religion lightly and worldly life hade duped them and with this text, advise them to instill fear in them for their evil deeds, and there shall be no sympathizer or support of them except God, and if they shall offer any compensation towards it, it will not be accepted.",

    "77. when the night followed, he saw Venus rising (addressing star worshippers, he said, “Can this be my Creator?” (He said to himself) when she set, “I do not approve of setting bodies (to be my Creator).”",
    "78. Then when he saw the Sun shining, he addressed the sun worshippers and said, “Can this grand body be my Creator?” And when the sun set he said, “Oh my tribe I am away from what you associate with.”",
    "79. Verily do I supplicate sincerely the Creator of the Heavens and earth and I am not among the associators.",
    "80. And his tribe disputed with him. He said, “What, are you disputing with him regarding God! Although he has guided, I do not fear those whom you associate with Him except what my God will. Knowledge of my creator is circumspective. What! Do you not understand so much?”",
    "81. How can I fear your associates? Where you do not fear while associating them with God, when He has not given any reason for your action? Which of us is entitled to safety (under Him), say if you know.",
    "82. Those who embraced faith and did not unpurify (their hearts) by adopting their spiritual leaders (except Divine Lights) they are under safety and they alone are guided.",
    "83. These were the arguments endowed upon Abraham by us to advance before his tribe, thus We exalt the grades of those whom We like. Verily your Providence is Wise and Knowing.",
    "84. And We endowed upon him Isaac (as his son) and Jacob (as his grandson). We guided each Our way, and We guided Noah before this, and from his lineage David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. Thus We reward the righteous.",

    "89. These are the very people on whom We have endowed the Text, Law, Prophetship. If the infidels (Quraish) disbelieve it, do not mind as We have fixed a tribe which will not deny them.",
    "90. These are the people whom God has shown the path, so you follow their track. Say, “I do nothing but an advice for the public at large.",
    "91. You have not appreciated God to the degree, he is worthy of appreciation. When they said God has not revealed anything to any of His creatures, say, “Who then sent the Text which Moses brought which was enlightenment and guidance for humans and which you have rent to pieces, par of which you expose and hide major part thereof, and you were taught what you and your forefathers did not know.” Say, “It was God (who sent it) and then leave them alone to rove in non-sensical topic.”",
    "92. And this Book which We revealed is auspicious confirming its preceding Text so as to warn you (oh Meccans) and those around it, and those who believe in eternity, put faith in it, and guard their prayers",
    "93. Who can be a greater tyrant than one who libels God (saying either he is a prophet or a Divine Light, while he is not so receiving any sort thereof), and he may say, “I shall transmit similar commands as God has done.” You would see them during tribulation of partition of soul, when death angels will demand of him to hand over to them his soul, saying, “Today you will be punished disgracefully for your imputation of false statements to God being proud of not following His Commands (Lights).”",
    "94. You have come to us single as We created you in the beginning, leaving behind what We have endowed upon you and We do not find those intercessors of yours in whom you have faith and to have had a share with Us in your creation. (Today) separation has been effected between you and them and the very thing you confided in has been lost upon you.",
    "95. Verily God is Creator of grain (faithful) and of seed (faithless) creates life from lifeless and vice versa (i.e. creates a faithful from a faithless and vice versa). This is God where you are roving about? (In physical world.)",

    "97. It is He Who has fixed the stars (Divine Lights) to lead you in darkness of land and sea. Of course, for the learned, We have openly described Commands.",

    "99. It is He, Who sends rain from clouds with which is grown every kind of vegetation from which We bring out green beans, yielding sticking grains: also from date trees whence hang down pendent fruits, and gardens of grapes, olives pomegranates, like and unlike, look at their ripening when they fructify. Verily, in this are signs for the faithful.",
    "100. And they made angels associates of God, although God has alone created them, and they attribute without knowledge to Him sons and daughters. Far glorious is His nature from what they attribute to him.",

    "104. Verily have come to you proofs from your Providence, so if any appreciates them, it is to their credit, and if they remain blind hearted, loss thereof shall be to them, you are not responsible to safeguard their acts.",
    "105. And We thus change the tone of our Commands (holding out hope and threats) so the infidel Quraish deem, you have learned it from outside and We explicitly describe for those who have knowledge (to appreciate).",
    "106. So you follow what is revealed unto you from your Providence, there is no other God but He and turn away from associators.",
    "107. (They say), “If God had willed they would not have associated others with Him”  and We have not made you to safeguard them nor are you in any way responsible for their acts.",
    "108. Do not abuse those who seek protection elsewhere leaving God, lest they may abuse God unknowingly out enmity",
    "109. They swore eagerly, if any miracle came to them they would embrace faith. Say, “Miracles are under Divine control, what do you know?” If they, even after seeking miracles, would embrace faith.",
    "110. And We shall upset their hearts and eyes as though they have not embraced faith and shall leave them to their destiny due to their arrogance, so they may rove in misguidance.",
    "111. Had We sent angels to them and the dead had talked to them and had We assembled every miracle of the past they would not have embraced faith, except what God had willed, although most do not understand.",
    "112. Similarly, for every Prophet have We appointed an enemy from human and spirit, who raise false propaganda with a view to beguiling the public and if your Providence had willed they dared not have done so, you leave them (to their faith) for their false propaganda.",
    "113. This, for this reason, their hearts are being engaged therein for not putting faith in enternity, and are pleased with what they are doing.",
    "114. What! Leaving God, shall I choose any other Judge (to decide between you and I on revelation) although he is the Self-same who revealed unto you the detailed Text?

This is good for you, if you are faithful.",

    "89. “We would be alleging against God if we reverted to your faith after having been delivered by God from it. What is up with us that we should revert to it, unless God, Our Providence, so chooses. Knowledge of our Providence is all prevailing, we have trust in God.

    "90. The infidel nobles of his tribe said, “If you follow Shu‘ayb, you will be losers.",
    "91. So the earthquake overtook them and they were destroyed in their homes.",
    "92. Who falsified Shu‘ayb and they were destroyed as though they never existed, those who falsified Shu‘ayb were the people to suffer.",
    "93. So Shu‘ayb turned his face from them and said, “Oh my tribe, I transmitted to you the message of my Providence and advised you too. Why should I be sorry for the disbelievers?",
    "94. And We did not send in any town any Prophet but when (they disbelieved him) We involved them in poverty and diseases so their hearts may soften.",
    "95. And when they importuned We replaced their adversity with amenities until they developed into horn of plenty and began to say such kind of adversities and prosperities passed over heads of our forefathers (and in spite of which they did not change their tenets of faith) why should we do so. then We seized them in such a state they were unaware.",
    "96. Had their residents of the town embraced faith and kept on fearing We would have opened to them blessings of Heaven and Earth, but they falsified (Divine Lights) so We seized them in proportion of their evil deeds.",
    "97. Have the townspeople become so very indifferent to Our wrath befalling them during night whilst they are asleep?",
    "98. Have they become so fearless as to face Our wrath during daylight while they are taken up in worldly pursuits?",
    "99. Are they prepared to face Divine wrath although none but the losing tribe of infidels can afford to do so?",
    "100. Did We not forewarn those who succeeded their predecessors on Earth that if We will due to their hearts thereby they could not have fathomed their cause?",
    "101. These towns which We have described to you We certainly sent prophets with miracles but they did not believe in them as they had already disbelieved in the previous spiritual life before coming on Earth . Thus does God seal the hearts of infidels.",
    "102. And We did not find most of them adhering to oath of fealty . We found most of them breaching the oath.",
    "103. Thereafter We sent Moses to Pharaoh and his courtiers with Our miracles which they disbelieved. Think over the consequences of the seditious.",
    "104. And Moses said, “Oh Pharaoh, verily I am a Prophet from the Providence of the World.”",
    "105. It Behooves I should not in the name of God, say anything but the truth. Of course, I am come to you from your Providence with miracles (rod and shining arm) so better let Bani Israel go with me.",
    "106. Pharaoh said, “If you have brought any miracle put them forth if you are true.”",
    "107. Moses cast his rod on the ground when suddenly it was an evident serpent.",
    "108. And when he took off his arm from his armpit it became shining like snow to onlookers.",
    "109. The courtiers of Pharaoh on seeing this said, “He is a learned magician.” (Pharaoh was about to put faith in Moses but was dissuaded).",
    "110. He intends thereby to expel you from your estate and populate Israel thereon, upon which Pharaoh said, “How do you advise me?”",
    "111. They said, “Detain Moses and his brother and send messengers in the villages in the state.” (They did not suggest killing Moses as none was a bastard.)",
    "112. To produce before you every learned magician.",
    "113. And these magicians came to Pharaoh and asked whether there was, in fact, a reward for them if they over-powered Moses.",
    "114. Pharaoh said, “Certainly yes. Verily, you shall be my courtiers.”",
    "115. They said, “Oh Moses, are you going to cast or shall we do so?”",
    "116. Moses said, “Better you do.” When they cast their ropes whereby they juggled by sleight of hand and threatened the spectators producing motions in the ropes like huge snakes.",
    "117. And We revealed unto Moses to cast his rod. When it started (on being cast) swallowing all what they had put forth through jugglery.",
    "118. Thus truth was confirmed and what they were practicing was falsified.",
    "119. The magicians then and there remained vanquished and disgraced.",
    "120. And they all fell in prostration",
    "121. saying, “We have put faith in the Providence of the world,",
    "122. providence of Moses and Aaron.”",
    "123. Then Pharaoh said, “Have you embraced faith before my permitting you. Verily, this is your intrigue which you have played in the estate to expel you from the estate” (just to stop the spectators from believing in Moses). Shortly shall you taste fruits (punishment thereof).",
    "124. Certainly shall I cut out your hands and legs crosswise and send you all to the gallows.",
    "125. They said, “We shall certainly revert unto your Providence.",
    "126. “You are enraged at us simply because we have believed in miracles of our Providence when they have come to us. Oh our Providence, grant us immense patience in our sufferings and end our lives supplicating You.”",
    "127. The courtiers of Pharaoh’s tribes said, “Are you leaving Moses and his sect scot-free to fan sedition on earth although they have forsaken you and your God through whose medium people used to seek your proximation?” Pharaoh said, “Shortly shall I slay their sons leaving their daughters and certainly We are over-powering.",
    "128. (As he was doing previously: Bani Israel were terrified and approached Moses) when Moses told his sect, “Pray assistance from God and be patient.” Verily, He is the land endows it on whomsoever He likes but eternity is for the virtuous.",
    "129. They said, “We suffered before your advent and after.” Moses replied, “Shortly shall your Providence destroy your enemies and make you their successors, when it is to be seen how you behave.”",
    "130. Verily did We punish the followers of Pharaoh by successive famine, dearth of food so they may take lessons.",
    "131. When they would have a bloom they would say it is due to us and when they would be involved in adversity they would attribute it to the ill-omen of Moses and his followers. Beware ill-omen is only under Divine control but most do not realize it.",
    "132. And they said, “Whenever you bring a miracle whereby you conjure us we shall not believe you.”",
    "133. So We sent them floods, plague, locusts, lice, destroying fields, frogs, blood. These were open miracles, but they were indifferent to them and were a criminal tribe.",
    "134. When Divine wrath fell upon them they said, “Oh Moses, pray to your Providence in accordance with which He has agreed to accept it. If you remove this disaster from us we shall believe in you and send with you Bani Israel.”",
    "135. So when He removed it from them, they kept on breaching their promise until they were destined to destruction by drowning.",
    "136. Finally, We avenged them by drowning them in the Red Sea as they had been continuously falsifying Our miracles and they are indifferent to Our punishment.",
    "137. And made the sect inherit which was deemed weak masters of the east and west lands which was blessed by Us due to so many prophets having lived and died there and thus was fulfilled the promise of your Providence in favour of Bani Israel for their patience (under sufferings of their male children being killed), and We destroyed all what Pharaoh and his followers were building and raising structures.",
    "138. And We took Bani Israel over the Red Sea where they reached a tribe who had stuck to idol worship. They told Moses make our god an idol as they have. Then Moses said, “Verily you are ignorant.”",
    "139. Those who are worshipping idols shall be destroyed and their acts shall be voided.",
    "140. He further said, “Leaving God shall I seek any other whereas He has exalted you over the world?”",
    "141. When We redeemed you from Pharaoh’s followers who were tormenting you horribly slaying your sons and leaving alive your daughters wherein was a severe trial for you.",
    "142. And We made a promise with Moses and Moses told his brother Aaron he should represent him in his absence among his tribe and keep on reproving them and need not follow the way of the dissenters.",
    "143. And when Moses came at Our fixed time and his God talked with him. Moses requested Him (on behalf of the tribe), “Oh my God, show me Yourself so I see You.” God replied, “You shall never see Me, but look at yonder mountain. If it will be stand in the same place then you will see Me.” When his God’s Light lighted up the mountain, it cracked into pieces and Moses fell fainted. When he recovered his senses he said, “Your Nature is pure and I adjure You to forgive my sins with Your Grace and I am the foremost of the faithful to (believe) in admitting, You cannot be been.",
    "144. Then God said, “Moses I have selected you, from among men, for My Prophet for conversation on Divine Mission. Therefore, take the Gospel for guidance which I have granted you and do thanks to me",
    "145. and We had written in it every kind of guidance and details for them, in slates and ordered them to follow it carefully, and tell your sect to select good (legal) things from it for action (avoiding illegal). Soon, I shall show you the destination (hell) of the disobedient.",
    "146. In a very short time I shall withhold from them aptitude of believing in My signs who are proud on the land. And if they will see every sign, they will never believe it, and if they will see the way of virtue they will never follow it. If they will see way of misguidance they will adopt it. This is why because they falsified Our signs (i.e. Divine Lights) and they were negligent of them.",
    "147. And those people who falsified our miracles and did not believe in Futurity, their acts will be voided. Will they get any reward other than for what they have done in disbelief?",
    "148. And during the absence of Moses, his sect under Samari made a calf of their molten jewellery which was a hollow model in which there was a sound of a cow. Did they not understand it did neither talk with them nor guide them on the right Path? With all these they did injustice (to God) in worshipping it.",
    "149. And when they were repentant excessively and understood they were misguided, then they prayed, if their God would not take pity on them and would not forgive them, then surely they would be among the sufferers.",
    "150. And when Moses returned to this sect indignant and grievous, he exclaimed, “How ill have you acted in my absence! How have you been in a hurry to look out for your Providence?” He threw down the Gospel from his hands in anger, and exhorted his brother, Aaron, taking a grip of his chin and dragging him towards self, when Aaron appealed, “Oh Brother, your sect rendered me helpless and they were almost about to kill me. Do not make me a laughing stock before them and do not take me among enemies.”",
    "151. Moses prayed to God, “Om my God, forgive me and my brother and admit both of us within Your Mercy and You are the Most Merciful of all.",
    "152. Soon Divine wrath would befall them from their God as a punishment for worshipping the calf, and they would be degraded in this world and We give such treatment to the mischievous",
    "153. and who committed evil and repented after their sins and believed in God. Of course, your God, on the reaction, is certainly a great Forgiver.",
    "154. When Moses’ fury cooled down, he picked up the slates (leaving the broken ones which disappeared) in those slates (“We have recorded) guidance and grace for those who feared their God.”",
    "155. And Moses selected 70 men from among his sect to witness the event of Our fixed period, and when they were overtaken by an earthquake, Moses prayed to God, “Oh my God, if You had wished, You would have killed them and me. What! Are you killing us for actions of the evil amongst us?” This is nothing but a trial of You, whereby You do deny the divine guidance from some unworthy. You have guide worthy, whom do you choose. You are our Lord, therefore, pray. Forgive us and shower pity on us and You are best at forgiveness.",
    "156. And record virtue in our favour in this world and in Eternity (grant us Paradise in its lieu). Certainly we have repented on our sins in Your presence. God said, “My wrath befalls on whomsoever I chose, My Mercy surrounds everything. Therefore, shortly shall I record My Mercy for them who fear me, and pay tithe and believe in Our Couplets.”",
    "157. Those people who follow the Prophet of Mecca, about whom is written in their gospels, they should believe in him who orders to do good, forbids evil, and who makes pure lawful and declares impure unlawful, and who removes burden of crimes and chains of fire, which lie on their necks. Therefore, who believes him as a prophet and reinforces him and help him and follows the light of guidance (Ali) who came with him, they are those to attain salvation.",
    "158. You say to the people, “You are the messenger for them all, from God (i.e. Divine Taught) whose sovereignty is in Heaven and the Earth.” There is no other God except He. He has power to kill and give life, therefore, you believe in God, and in His Prophet of Mecca, who, too believes in Him, and carries out His commands and follow him to attain salvation",
    "159. and among Moses sect, there was one group, who guided people on the right path and decided on justice.",
    "160. And We had divided them in 12 groups, and revealed unto Moses when his sect prayed to him for water, to strike his rod on the stone, when 12 springs gushed out flowing; every group knew its spring well and We had afforded a shelter of clouds upon them and bestowed upon them Manna and Quail and told them to eat pure of Our gift and not to disobey Us but they were doing harm to self.",
    "161. And remember the time when they were told to live in the village and eat there of what they liked, and further ordered on saying, “Hitta” to enter the door, bowing down their heads in obedience, then We shall forgive their sins soon, and shall bless those who shall do good acts",
    "162. and those who were disobedient among them, replaced Our word “Hitta” with another and upon which We cast a Divine wrath unto them for their disobedience.",
    "163. And ask them about the condition of the village, which was on the seashore. Villagers of which used to disobey orders relating to Saturday fish used to come the shore on this day and when there was no Saturday, they would not come. Thus We tried them for their disobedience.",
    "164. And remember the time when some among the sect asked them why they advised them whom God desired to kill or was about to punish severely. They replied, “They did so as a plea before their Creator, so they might refrain.”",
    "165. When they disregarded the advice given to them, We saved those from punishment who prevented them and punished others severely for disobedience.",
    "166. When they exceeded limits of disobedience, We told them to be mean monkeys.",
    "167. And remember the time when your God warned you He would raise a nation who would punish them until the Day of Judgment. Of course, He is equally Merciful to the penitent.",
    "168. And We divided them in groups on land some of those were virtuous and others remained otherwise, and We tried them in joy and pain so they may revert to Us.",
    "169. And after their death, followed in progeny such unfit heirs, to Gospel they would stoop to take wealth of this temporary world and go on saying soon their sins would be forgiven. And when they would have an opportunity of getting such wealth (Bribe, etc.) what! was not taken a promise from them that nothing except truth must be told, respecting God? And state what they have studied on the whole te3xt, which was in the Book, and eternity is reserved for those who fear God. Do they not understand so much?",
    "170. And those who adhere strictly to the Book, and are constant at prayers, of course, We shall void the rewards of the rectifiers.",
    "171. And remember the time when We lifted Mount Sinai and kept it over them hanging, like a cloud, while they thought it would fall at any time, and We told them to grip it tightly and remember all that was in it, so they would be virtuous.",
    "172. And (remember the time) when God created souls of generations of Adam before sending them to this world and exacted a promise from them to bear witness against their admission and asked, “Am I not your God.” Everybody replied, “Of course You are our God.” We warn you of this testimony lest on the Day of Judgment you might not plead an excuse you were uninformed.",
    "173. Or would say, “Our father, forefathers associated before our creation.” What! Are You punishing us on the acts of actual associators?",
    "174. And thus explicitly do We describe Our Couplets so they may revert to us from polytheism.",
    "175. And read out to them the history of the person who granted a miracle by us, then he kept off from it, then the devil pursued him, he was among the misguided.",
    "176. If We wanted to force guidance, We would have given him a high grade, but he threw himself to the ground (degraded) he followed his passion. Therefore, his example is similar to that of a dog who would bark at you, whether you attack him or let him off scot free. This is a similar case of those who falsified Our couplets. Therefore, you go on telling this fact so they may think over (their actions)",
    "177. their similitude is very bad, who falsified Our Couplets and wronged themselves.",
    "178. “That alone is guided who gets guidance of God (through His Divine Light)” and “from whom reason is withheld they are the losers.”",
    "179. And We have created many people and spirits for hell, they have hearts but cannot understand and have eyes but cannot see, have ears but cannot hear, they are like cattle, rather worse than cattle, they are negligent of duty.",
    "180. And all the glorious names are for God you call Him with these names and leave them up, who associate those of their chice they will soon get the punishment for what they have done.",
    "181. There is a group among those who were created by Us who used to guide to the right path and decide accordingly.",
    "182. We shall gradually arrest them who falsified Our couplets in a way so they would not understand.",
    "183. I shall give them a chance (to penance) of course my actions are mighty.",
    "184. What! Did they not think their Prophet does not act under (evil) spirit’s influence? He is nothing but an open warner.",
    "185. What! Did they not give thought to kingdoms of Heaven and Earth and their creations created by God (to admit warnings of the Prophet). Perhaps as mortal, their hour of death is near and (they should look sharp). Therefore, in which other fact will they be convinced after this “Qur’an” having so vividly forewarned them?",
    "186. There is no other guide for him whom God leaves to his fate to wander blindly (without any authorized guide).",
    "187. People ask you about the Day of Judgment as to when is its appointed hour? Say, “Verily its knowledge is reserved to God and on its approach shall He alone declare it.” It shall be an awful time for residents of Heaven and earth. It shall fall all of a sudden. They ask you, in such a manner, as though you were its repositor, you tell them its knowledge is limited to God alone, but most do not understand.",
    "188. And say, “You do not hold power to do good or ever to self, except what God wills it. Had I known the facts of secrecy, I would have collected many things to profit self and evil would not have touched me, and I am simply an Evangelist and warner to those who believe in God.”",
    "189. It is He who created you all from one substance and from its remaining earth. He created his comrade so as to take liking to him, and on conjugation she conceived petty embryo, which she carried, which she carried, which, when on development, became heavy, both prayed to God. If You would bestow a safe and sound child, we both shall be grateful.",
    "190. When He gave them a safe and sound child, his generation started associating with Him, although God is superior to all which they are associating.",
    "191. What! Do they associate them who do not create anything but rather are created by Him?",
    "192. Neither can they help others nor can they help themselves.",
    "193. And if they call them to the right path they will never follow you. Either way is ineffective whether you call them or you keep quite.",
    "194. In fact, if you call upon them, except God, they are creators like you. Better call them and see if you are right in your view whether they reply to you.",
    "195. Have they real legs with which they walk or have they hands for grip? Heave they eyes for sight? Or have they ears to hear? Tell them to call upon their gods and hten intrigue against Me and do not let me have an opportunity.",
    "196. Of course, God is your saviour who sent a holy book and He keeps friendship with the virtuous",
    "197. and those whom you are calling, can neither help you nor to self.",
    "198. If you call them to the right path they will never hear anything and you think they are looking at you.",
    "199. Therefore, take to overlook their short comings and advise them to virtue and turn away from the mischievous,",
    "200. and whenever you get excited under the Devil’s instigation, seek Divine Protection who is All-hearing and all-knowing.",
    "201. Of course, those who fear Us when the devil excites them pray to Us when they immediately become informed (of the situation).",
    "202. Their brothers keep them in misguidance in which they do not make slightest relaxation.",
    "203. And when you do not bring any miracle they say, “Why did you not bring any selected miracle?” You say, “I only follow from my God.” These are for those who believe in God, are proofs and guidance and Divine Mercy for them.",
    "204. And when the Qur’an is being read you must keep quiet and listen to it so you would be treated graciously.",
    "205. Call upon your God importunately or silently in your hearts, without loud cries, day and night and be not among the negligent.",
    "206. Of course, those who are near Us do not turn away from praying to Us, rather glorify Us and all along prostrate to Us."

    "5. With completion of faith the faithful shall enter paradise with its increase, grades will be granted and with its deficiency, they will undergo punishment in hell. As God removed you from your home, on a great cause, which did not find favour with a group of the faithful.",
    "6. They are inquisitive about truth in spite of the fact it has been openly exposed to them, they are being driven to death seemingly.",
    "7. Remember the time when God had promised you, that among two groups, one will be yours and you wanted the one of a lower strength and dignity falls prey to you ad God wanted to prove, “Truth with justice by His words and Divine Lights as true warriors and to cut off progeny of the disobedient.”",
    "8. So as to prove truth of Islam by vanquishing paganism, which though will grieve infidels (by loss of life and property).",
    "9. Remember the time when you prayed to God and He replied He would help you with 1000 angels who would assist you being on your back.",
    "10. God did not lend this support except to encourage your followers by tidings and consolation of their hearts although real help is from God alone. Of course, God is Almighty and Wise.",
    "11. And remember the time when God over-powered you with sleep to give you rest and sent rain from clouds to purify you and to remove the filth of the Devil (night discharge) from you and to strengthen your hearts, and make your steps steadfast.",
    "12. Remember the time when your God was inspiring angels, under revelation, which He was with them. Therefore, they should encourage them to be steady who have faith in God. Soon He would infuse into hearts of infidels. His awe, therefore, should hit blows on necks and joints.",
    "13. This is because they were against God and His Prophet. God is certainly Almighty at punishment.",
    "14. This is your punishment, therefore, you taste it and certainly for infidels is the punishment of Hell.",
    "15. Oh believers do not turn away your backs while fighting with infidels.",
    "16. And on that day, if anybody turns his back, except to avoid stroke or reinforce his own party from the other side, certainly he will be under Divine wrath and hell is his destination and which is awful residence.",
    "17. Do not brag you killed them but God killed them by sending angels and asking the Prophet to stone them and “Oh Prophet! When you were throwing pebble towards them, you did not throw them, but in effect, God threw them.” So God may grant booty to the faithful. Of course, God is All-hearing and All-knowing.",
    "18. This is the way God renders useless plans of infidels.",
    "19. If you desire victory, the victory has come to those entitled, i.e. who were faithful. It is better for you if you, “Oh infidels,” avoid enmity of the Prophet and give up infidelity in you in the future, and if you will repeat, We shall act likewise. When your group, howsoever large it may be, will not help you and God verily is with the faithful.",

    "50. Alas! If you will see when death angels take out the souls of infidels, and be striking on their faces and backs, telling them to taste the punishment of partition of the soul.",
    "51. This reward is due to your deeds, done by your hands and God is not unjust to His creatures.",
    "52. Alike Pharaoh’s followers and those who preceded them, they falsified the proofs in miracles of God and God arrested them in lieu of their sins. Of course, God is mighty at punishment.",
    "53. It is for this in which God does not change His Bounties endowed on a community, until and unless, it may not change its character, (obedient) of course God is All-hearing and All-knowing.",
    "54. Alike Pharaoh’s followers and those who preceded them, they falsified their God’s couplets and We destroyed them for their sins, and drowned the followers of Pharaoh and they were all disobedient.",
    "55. Of course, those men are the worst animals before God, who became infidels and do not put faith unto God.",
    "56. Those who promised you and then breached their promise, every time, and do not fear God.",
    "57. Therefore, if you overpower them in the fight you will disperse those who assist them so they may remember.",
    "58. If you hesitate, the sect would breach the pact with you, you can, on similar lines treats them by breaching the pact. Of course, God does not like those who are not honest in maintaining a pact.",
    "59. And those who became infidels must not think they surpassed Us and certainly they cannot render Us helpless.",
    "60. And amass sinews of war and power, which you can provide with as much cavalry you can maintain. Keep them ready to face the infidels with which you can frighten God’s enemy, and your enemies and besides them, you can frighten other people and whom you do not know but God knows them better and whatever you are spending for the sake of God, you will be rewarded wholly and there will be no loss to you.",
    "61. If they will submit to the truce you also concede to it, and trust in God, of course, He is All-hearing and All-knowing.",
    "62. If they would like to deceive you, God is enough for you, He is who helped you with support of angels and the faithful.",
    "63. And produced love in their hearts. If you had spent all of earth you could not have produced love in their hearts, of course He is Mighty and Wise.",
    "64. Oh Prophet, God is sufficient for you and among the faithful, those which follow you.",
    "65. Oh Prophet, stir up the faithful to fight. If there will be 20 patients among you, they will overpower 200 infidels and if there will be 100 they will over 1000 infidels. It is why because infidels ware those who do not understand anything.",
    "66. Now God has relaxed in your matter by reducing (the multiple factor to 20 percent) and know among you there are weak. Therefore, if there will be 100 patient among you they will over power 200 infidels and if there will be 1000 they will over power 2000 under Divine commands and God is with the patient.",
    "67. It is not right for the Prophet when he has infidel prisoners until he kills them, you are desirous of worldly gains and God wants Eternity for you, God is Might and Wise.",
    "68. If God had not written out in His record, i.e. legalized ransom being discretionary to the Prophet, verily you would have been punished severely for what you have advised the Prophet to prefer the ransom to killing captives.",
    "69. And now enjoy what you have taken in the ransom amount as lawful and pure and fear God and of course God is great at forgiveness and granting Mercy.",
    "70. Oh Prophet, tell those prisoners who are in your hands, if God will find any kind of virtue in their hearts, what is taken from them He will grant better than that, and will forgive their sins. Of course, God is Mighty at Forgiveness and granting Mercy.",
    "71. If they are bent upon being dishonest to you as they did in the past to God and upon which He made you over power them, and God is All-knowing and Wise.",
    "72. Those who are worthy of praise, who embraced, who fled with the Prophet from Mecca to Medina, and fought at a risk of their property and lives for the sake of God, and those gave shelter and helped emigrants are friends with one another, and those who embraced faith but did not flee, you have no responsibility to guard them until they fled and (left Mecca, their home for Medina) if they thus asked help from in religion (by fleeing) you will have to protect them, except against the sect with whom you have contracted a pact. God is All-seeing what you are doing.",
    "73. And those who became infidels, they are assistants of one another, and if you will not act according to Our Commandments, there will be a great revolution on Earth and lead to a world war.",
    "74. They are the true faithful who embraced faith who fled and participated in Crusade for the sake of God and who gave shelter and assisted them.",
    "75. And those who embraced faith later, and fled and in company with you, they fought against the infidels, are counted with you, and relatives, as heirs to the proper ties of one another, some are superior to others, by nearness according to the commands of God in text, of course, God is All-knowing."

Of course, God is mighty at forgiveness and granting mercy.",
    "6. If anybody among the infidels seeks your shelter, you give him so he may listen to the word of God and send him to his home. It is because these persons are a sect not knowing anything.",

    "10. They will neither regard relationship nor terms of their treaty to the faithful. They are great transgressors.",

    "18. They alone are competent to occupy the Holy sanctuary who have faith in God and on the Day of Judgment, and pray regularly and pay tithe and not fear anybody except God. It is hoped of them they might be guided.",
    "19. Have you equalized those who give water to pilgrims and frequent the mosque with those who fought in a crusade for the sake of God? They are not equal before God and God does not guide the disobedient.",

    "28. Oh Believers, “It is nothing but associators who are impure. Therefore, they shall not enter the Holy Sanctuary of Mecca after this year.

    "29. Among them are those who have received revealed books who do not believe in God and the Day of Judgment and do not illegalize what God and His Prophet have made unlawful and do not accept Islam as the true Religion. You go on fighting with them so long as they do not give income tax by being disgraced.",
    "30. And the Jews claimed Ezra was the son of God and the Christians claimed Messiah was the son of God. These are statements of their own making. They are talking alike their preceding infidels; be they damned where are they being misled!",

Do not be disobedient in this matter and fight unitedly against associators as they do against you and know of course, God is with the virtuous.",
    "37. It is nothing but deferring of the holy months is transgression due to infidelity of infidels, to gain their booty in warfare, whereby they are further misled in misguidance. They legalize warfare in one year and illegalize in the other, so they may fulfil the number of holy months in a year fixed by God.

    "43. Right all, God forgave you! Why did you permit them to stay away from the crusade? Else it would have been clear to you who are sincere and who are otherwise.",
    "44. Those who believe in God and the Day of Judgment do not ask permission to participate in the crusade with property and life, and God is acquainted with the virtuous.",

    "62. They swear by God, they are faithful so you may be pleased with them, whereas God and His Prophet are more entitled in which they should please them by their sincerity, if they are faithful.",
    "63. Did they not understand so much that he who disobeys God and the Prophet is certainly to be condemned to hell wherein shall he permanently live?",
    "64. They are afraid a chapter be revealed, regarding them, exposing what is in their hearts. Tell them you play mischief and god shall verily expose.",

    "73. Oh you Prophet, fight against infidels in company of hypocrites exhorting them. Their destination is Hell, a horrible resort.",
    "74. They defend by swearing falsely by God and they did not say verily they made a statement of infidelity and after embracing Islam, they turned infidels and resolved what they could not do, and they turned against God and His prophet because they were enriched out of Divine grace, by getting large booties making them independent of their original profession, instead of being grateful to God and the Prophet.

    "60. These were the people who were cursed in the world and eternity, too. Beware Hud’s tribe were infidel to their Providence. Beware, for Hud’s community there is a curse.",
    "61. And We sent Salih, their brother, to the tribe of Samood. Salih said, “Oh my tribe, pray unto God, besides whom there is no God. It is He who created you out of earth and gave you long life. Better pray forgiveness and direct yourselves to him. Verily, my Providence is ready to accept your (prayers).”",
    "62. The tribe said, “Oh Salih, we were formerly attached to you, do you now prevent us from worshipping those whom our forefathers worshipped? Of course, we are in great doubt of what you are inviting to us.”",
    "63. Salih said, “Oh my tribe, if I am right from my Providence, Who has endowed on me His mercy (guidance), who will help me if I disobey Him and listen to you? You will simply increase my losses.”",
    "64. “Oh my tribe, I am offering herewith a young she-camel (as a miracle) and a sign from God. Leave her on Earth (to graze) without injuring her, lest you might be involved soon in Divine wrath.”",
    "65. They cut down her udders when Salih said, “You enjoy three days in your homes. It is a decisive promise from God for your destruction.”",
    "66. So, when Our promised punishment came over them We saved Salih and those who had put faith in him, our of Our mercy, from a disgraceful punishment of the day. Verily, your Providence is Almighty and Omnipotent.",
    "67. And a sharp shriek seized the disobedient and they collapsed where they were, as though they were not residing therein.",

    "73. The angels replied, “Are you surprised at the Almighty’s powers? Be Divine mercy and bounty on you, oh you members of the Prophet’s family!",
    "74. When fear left Abraham with these tidings, they began todiscuss with the angels ont he affairs of Lot.",
    "75. Verily Abraham was forbearing and highly reverting unto God.",
    "76. (They said), “Let that affair go, do not talk about it, this is assumed a decisive command from your Lord, verily punishment shall fall upon them without suspension,.",
    "77. And when Our messengers went to Lot, he was constrained within himself, and said, “This is an awful day.”",
    "78. And there came running to him his tribe who were mal-practicing in Sodomy ere that. Lot said, “Oh my tribe, you have maids of my tribe for your legal marriage. Fear God and do not disgrace me before my guests. Is there none amongst you a wise follow?”",
    "79. They said, “You know we have nothing to do with your females, and you know well what our desire is.”",
    "80. Lot said, “I wish I was well fortified against you or secured a stronger shelter against you.”",
    "81. When the angels said, “Oh Lot, we are your Divine Messengers, they cannot approach us. You better hurry up with your family, before day breaks, and none should look behind except your wife, who is disobedient. Certainly, what is destined shall occur to them. Verily, the promise is to come, after day dawn, and is not the daybreak close at hand?”",
    "82. And when Our punishment came We (raising them) threw them topsy-turvy and poured fire and brimstone.",
    "83. These were duly earmarked, before your God. This is not a matter of amazement that the disobedient should be so treated and cursed.",
    "84. And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shuy‘ab, who said, “Oh my tribe, worship God, barring whom there is no other God, and do not under measure and under weigh (articles). I am your well-wisher, and I am afraid for you of the punishment of the day, which shall envelope all.”",
    "85. “And oh my tribe, measure duly and weigh justly, and do not put men to loss on any account, and do not move about on Earth fanning sedition.",
    "86. “I, as a Divine Light, am a blessing to you (responsible for your acts.”",
    "87. They said, “Oh Shu‘ayb, does your prayer order you we should give up worshipping them whom our forefathers did? Or order you we should give up spending our property as we like? And verily you are forbearing and wise (want of social justice).”",
    "88. Shu‘ayb said, “You see, if I am on the right path from my God, Who has provided me with pure provision, and I do not intend to wilfully oppose you in preventing you. I intend to be the best of my ability, to reform your evil (imperious) habits and this is nothing but God’s endowment of ability on me. In Him I trust, and to Him I shall revert.",

    "90. Pray forgiveness from God and revert unto Him (by penance). Verily, my Providence is Merciful and Affection.",
    "91. They said, “Oh Shua‘yb, much of whatever you advise us is not appreciable, and we notice, of course, you are weak, (you have no influence over us), had it not been for your large family, we would have stoned you to death, and you have no power over us.”",
    "92. Shu‘ayb said, “Oh my tribe, you have greater feeling towards my family than my God, and you have set aside Divine Commands. Verily, my Providence, for action, has a circumspective influence over you.”",
    "93. “Oh my tribe, do what you like in your place and truly, I do likewise. Shortly, you will see whom disgraceful punishment seizes, and who is a liar. Wait. I am also waiting with you.”",
    "94. And when Our punishment came, we save Shu‘ayb and those who had believed in him with Our mercy, and then shriek seized the disobedient and they sat dead where they were.",

    "99. Curse has followed them in this world and shall be on Judgment Day, too. What a bad reward is for them!",
    "100. This is the history of the people in the past which are still available and others are destroyed.",
    "101. We did not tyrannize them. Rather, they tyrannized themselves, and those whom they were worshipping did not help them save God, when punishment from your Providence came to them, and they did not add anything but misery to themselves (by their acts).",
    "102. Similarly your Providence seized citizens who were disobedient. Verily, His seizure is terrible.",

    "110. Verily, We gave Moses the Text which they differed. Had it not been for your Providence, decision before this, it would have been decided immediately. On this account, they are in doubt regarding Day of Judgment.",

    "3. We now describe the best of historical facts of the Text, of which you were unaware before this.",
    "4. Recall when Joseph told his father, “Oh my father, I dreamt 11 planets, the sun and the moon kneeling down before me.”",
    "5. Father said, “Oh my son, do not describe it before your brothers lest they plot against you out of jealousy. Verily the devil is an open enemy of man.”",
    "6. Similarly, your Providence will select you and will train you in diagnosing dreams and will fulfil His bounties as He did on Jacob’s family and his father Abraham and Isaac before this. Verily, your providence is All-knowing.",
    "7. Verily, in the Qur’an in the life of Joseph and his brothers, there are signs for an inquisitive mind.",
    "8. When the brothers said (among themselves), “Our father is more attached to Joseph than us although we are stronger. Verily, Our father is in the wrong.",
    "9. “(Better therefore) we kill Joseph or leave him in the desert to make room to the father, for our affection when we shall become a virtuous group.”",
    "10. One of them said, “Do not kill Joseph, but throw him into a deep well to be picked up by a traveller if you are determined to do away with him.”",
    "11. Upon this they told their father, “What is up with you regarding Joseph? You do not rely on us although we are his well wishers?",
    "12. “Send him tomorrow morning with us so he may enjoy the fruits of the desert and play about and certainly we shall look after him.”",
    "13. Jacob said, “I am afraid you get engrossed in your play, leaving him alone, so as to be devoured by a wolf while you are indifferent.”",
    "14. They said, “How can that be, Father, when we are so strong? Certainly, in that caswe, we shall be disgraced.”",
    "15. So, when they took him, they resolved (upon the plot they had matured) and threw him into a deep well. When We informed Joseph, under inspiration about their plot while they were unaware.",
    "16. And they came to their father, towards night, weeping (shedding crocodile tears).",
    "17. They said, “Oh Father, we let off Joseph to look after our goods and set out on our play. In the meanwhile, the wolf devoured him, and your not going to believe us, even if we are true.”",
    "18. And they produced his apron, dipped in blood (of a sacrificed goat). Jacob said, “You are playing the game with me. I shall hold my peace and God will assist me in your allegation.”",
    "19. And there came a caravan which sent their slave to fetch water with a bucket, and when he raised it up from the well he found a handsome chap (in Joseph) and Good knew what they did.",
    "19. They (the brothers of Joseph) came to know and stated he was their slave and sold him for a trifling price as they were already fed up with him.",
    "21. and told his queen Zulaikha to look after him carefully, as he may benefit them or they may ultimately adopt him, a prince (they having no issue). Thus, We gave him an exalted place of residence in a foreign country and taught him the science of diagnosing dreams, and God is Almighty in His affairs, although most do not know.",
    "22. And when he attained maturity, We endowed upon him, Lawa and Divine Knowledge, and thus He rewards the virtuous.",
    "23. And Zulaikha desired Joseph, of her own accord, and closed the doors, and asked for an intercourse with her, in default of punishment. He (Joseph) said, “I seek Divine refuge, the king has only title, thereto.” Verily, the disobedient shall never attain salvation.",
    "24. And she tried her best (to achieve her object) and he tried his best (to escape the plot) and had not his Providence shown His signs, he would have been entrapped. Thus We saved him from fornication and murder. Verily he was among the sincere devotees of God.",
    "25. And he ran towards the door, to get away and she pursued him catching hold of his shirt from behind, which was torn to pieces, and doors opened and the King was seen standing. When she addressed him “What should be the punishment except imprisoning or intensely hammering one who attacks his wife (with evil intention).”",
    "26. Joseph, in defence said, “Rather, she invited me to gain her aim.” The baby in her relation, in testimony, automatically spoke out (in affording judgment), “Joseph is to blame if the front part of the shirt is torn, and Zulaikha innocent",
    "27. and if otherwise, Joseph is true and she is false.”",
    "28. And when they found the shirt was torn from behind, the King remarked, “This is a female plot and verily they are mighty at plotting.",
    "29. “Oh Joseph, overlook this (libel),” and asked Zulaikha to apologize, as she was to blame.",
    "30. And the ladies of the metropolis said, “The King’s queen desired to allure the slave, deputed as a guard over the palace, out of her infatuation with him. Verily we find her misguided clearly.",
    "31. When she heard their misgivings, she invited them, give limes with a knife to each lady invited, and sent for Joseph to present before them. On seeing him, they were all infatuated with him, and instead of cutting the limes given to them, they cut off their fingers, and said, “By God, he is super human! He is nothing but a lovely angel.”",
    "32. When Zulaikha said to them, “Was it for this (affair in which you also are implicated) which you are blaming me? Verily I was infatuated, but he was innocent and if he would not comply with my request, he will undergo punishment in jail, where he will be disgraced.”",
    "33. Upon this, Joseph prayed to God, imprisonment is preferable to her (evil) call, and if Thou didst not protect me, I shall be involved in a calamity and be one of the disobedient.",
    "34. His Providence accepted his prayers and averted her intrigue. Verily, He is Hearing and Knowing.",
    "35. Thereafter, seeing all these signs, she started intriguing, and finally got him imprisoned for a long time (20 years).",
    "36. And entered with Joseph in the jail two more people – King (Pharaoh’s) (Butler and Baker) one of them said, “I have dreamt I draw win,” and the other said, “I dreamt I carry bread over my head which is being eaten away by birds, interpret these dreams, as we see you obliging.”",
    "37. Joseph said, “I shall interpret them to you. This is because my Lord has taught me; verily I have given up belief in those who do not believe in God and Eternity.”",
    "38. I follow the faith of my forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is not fit for us to associate any with God and this is Divine Grace on us and most men are ungrateful.",
    "39. Oh my jail brethren, tell e which is better of the tow, “God alone is Almighty or a collection of gods”",
    "40. whom you pray, barring Him, but are names given by you and by your forefathers, as regards whom God has not revealed any proof as all real power lies God alone, Who has commanded us not to worship any but Him, and this the right faith, although most do not know.",
    "41. Oh my companions of the jail, one of you will draw wine for his king, (and will be restored to his post) and the other will be beheaded, who has seen breads being eaten away by birds. It so decided by God the Almighty about which you have asked me.",
    "42. And so Joseph told him whose life was to spared to recommend him before his King. The devil made him forget and so Joseph lay in jail for 20 years.",
    "43. And the king said, “Verily I have dreamt a dream of seven fat cows being devoured by seven weak cows, and seven green ears of corn and seven dry ones. Oh my courtiers, diagnose this dream if you can.”",
    "44. They said, “These are confusing dreams and we do not know how to interpret them correctly.”",
    "45. In the meanwhile, the butler (who was once in the jail with Joseph) recollected, after some time, said, “I can get you the correct interpretation if you let me go to the jail (to Joseph).”",
    "46. So, he came over to Joseph and said, “Oh you truthful fellow, diagnose the dream wherein seven fat cows are being devoured by seven weeks, and seven green ears of corn have been would by seven dry ears, so I can go and inform them.",
    "47. He said, “For seven years you will have a blooming crop and out of which you will cut only requisite quantity, leaving the rest of them in the husk and rationing it.",
    "48. “Then will follow seven years of famine in which you will utilize residue of the previous blooming years in which you have cut.",
    "49. “Thereafter will follow a prosperous year wherein people will drink and eat.",
    "50. And the king said, “Bring him to me.” When the royal messenger came to Joseph, Joseph said, “Go to your Majesty and pray to him to investigate the ease of those ladies who had cut down their fingers. Verily, my God, the Lord knows the tactics of women.”",
    "51. And the king sent for them and asked them what they had to say in the mater. They said, “By God, we found Joseph innocent.” The king’s wife, Zulaikha, testified to them, the truth being out, “I (Zulaikha)) persuaded him and he was true in his statement.”",
    "52. “That this is so, the people may understand I (Joseph) am not dishonest and verily God does not support the dishonest",
    "53. “and I am not free from influence of evil passion. Verily evil passion drags men to evil things except whom my Providence mercified. Verily, my Providence is Forgiving and Merciful.”",
    "54. And the king exonerated him and asked him to be set free from jail and said, “I shall reserve him for state services.” And when Joseph came to the king, the king said, “From today you are my trustworthy secretary.”",
    "55. Then Joseph asked to be raised to the grade of Financial and Revenue Minster.",
    "56. This is the way We made Joseph powerful in the land. We make whomever We like, We shower grace on whoever We choose. We do not waste the reward of the obliging.",
    "57. And the reward of eternity is far superior for the faithful who are virtuous.",
    "58. And the brothers came to Joseph and entered his palace, when Joseph recognized them and they did not.",
    "59. And when everybody was paid his ration, Joseph told them “Bring your brother Benjamin from your father. Do you not see I have paid you full and I am your best patron?",
    "60. “And if you will not bring him you will not have his share from me nor shall see you in my presence.”",
    "61. They said, “We shall persuade our father and we shall make our best attempt at it.”",
    "62. And said Joseph to his servant to return their money in their respective sacks to enable them to realize his obligation and induce them again to come to him after returning home.",
    "63. And when they returned home, they told their father they would be prevented from getting Benjamin’s share until he sent him with them and they would surely look after him.",
    "64. The father said, “Am I to trust you as I did regarding his elder brother (Joseph) as before although God is a better protector and most merciful of all?”",
    "65. When they opened their sacks the found their money returned back to them. They said, “Oh Father, look what is up with us! This money is also returned to us and we shall bring food for our family, guarding our brother (Benjamin) getting an extra camel load of ration towards his share and the present ration will not last long.",
    "66. Father said, “I am not going to send him until you pledge Divine security, except when you are all captured.” And when they gave Divine security, Jacob said, “I hold God witness to your pledge.”",
    "67. And father advised them not to enter the city from one gate but from separate gates and said, “Although I cannot save you against the Divine decree, the final decision is with God in Whom I trust and all those who believe in Him should trust him.”",
    "68. And so when they entered the city, as per orders of their father, nothing could saved them from Divine decree except to fulfil Jacob’s desire who had limited knowledge granted by Us, but most of them do not know.",
    "69. When they saw Joseph he called to (Benjamin) privately and told him, “Do not be sorry for their actions.”",
    "70. And when he paid them their shares (they left the palace). The Estate servants came to the caravan and cried, “Come on you thieves.”",
    "71. They said, “What have you lost?”",
    "72. The servants said they had lost the Estate measure, and “He who traces it will get a camel load as a present and I am responsible to get it for him.”",
    "73. They said, “By God, you know we have not come here to be seditious and we are not thieves.”",
    "74. He Said, “What would be the punishment if you proved liars.”",
    "75. They said, “Jail for him in whose sack is found the measure, for such is the punishment of the offender.”",
    "76. They started searching the sacks of the brothers and finally traced it out from Benjamin’s sack. Thus played Joseph the tact, to test further their fidelity, as he could not hold back his brother otherwise, according to the government rules in force, except by means designed by God. We raise the grades of those whom We like and in respect of knowledge, one is superior to the other (until it ends in Him).",
    "77. They said, “If he has stolen, so had his elder brother Joseph behaved likewise in the past.” On hearing this, Joseph kept the secret within him, and did not expose it to them, but said, “You are rascals. God knows what you mean.”",
    "78. They said, “Oh Lord, our father is very aged. Hold anybody else instead of Benjamin. Verily you are obliging.”",
    "70. Joseph said, “God protect me, if I held anybody else than the thief with whom the lost article has been traced, and in that case I should be to blame.”",
    "80. So, when they became disappointed in relief of Benjamin, the eldest brother, Judas, said, “Do you not remember we have given a pledge of God to our father, and before this you have already done injustice to his elder brother Justice. So I shall not leave this land until I get Father’s permission or God decides otherwise and He is best at decision.",
    "81. “Therefore, go to your father and tell him, “Verily your son has stolen and we are testifying to what we are testifying to what we have been witness, personally and we are not responsible for his private behaviour.",
    "82. Ask the coming caravan which was with us and we are true in our statement.”",
    "83. Father said, “You are following passion. I shall hold my piece, probably God will assemble us all very son. Verily, He is knowing and wise.”",
    "84. So Jacob turned his face from them and sighed, recollecting the separation of his son, Joseph, and kept on weeping until he lost his eye sight through grief and anger.",
    "85. His sons said, “Are you going to destroy your life for Joseph’s sae until you become ill or die.”",
    "86. Father said, “I bewail my own misfortune before God and I know from God what you do not know.",
    "87. “Oh my sons, go in search of Joseph and his brother, Benjamin and do not be disappointed in Divine mercy, for evidently none but the infidels lose hope in God.”",
    "88. So when they again came to Egypt and paid a visit to Joseph, they said, “You respected sir, grief has gained round us and we have brought little money on which you can give us our ration as charity, God may bless you.”",
    "89. Joseph said, “Will you recollect how you have behaved with Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?”",
    "When Joseph removed his mask, they cried out in surprise, “Is it you Joseph?” He said, “Yes, I am Joseph and here is my brother Benjamin. Verily God has obliged us and verily He does not waste the reward of those who are pious and patient.”",
    "91. They said, “Verily God has endowed on you superiority over us and we have been in the wrong.”",
    "92. Joseph said, “I forgive and may God forgive you, too, as He is most merciful.”",
    "93. “God and take this shirt of mine and put it on the face of our father which will restore his eye sight and come back all of you to me.”",
    "94. When the caravan approached the city their father said, “If you do not falsify me, I breathe Joseph’s scent.”",
    "95. They said, “By God you are raving in misguidance of old.”",
    "96. And when Basheer came and put over Jacob’s face the shirt of Joseph, Lo, the eye sight was restored immediately, when Jacob said, “Did I not tell you I know what you do not.”",
    "97. They said, “Oh father, we pray unto you to forgive our sins, verily we were in the wrong.”",
    "98. Jacob said, “My providence may forgive you too. Verily, He is Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "99. And when the parent visited Joseph, he seated them by his side and said, “Be in Egypt now, God willing, you will be saved.”",
    "100. And Joseph made his parents sit on the throne and his brothers knelt down before him when Joseph said, “Oh Father, this is the diagnosis of my dream I dreamt before this, veracity of which my God has now demonstrated and verily He obliged me when He took me out of prison ad brought all of you to me from across the forest, under reconciliation, when the devil had made a split amongst us. Verily my Providence is merciful on him whom He likes. He is Omniscient and Wise.",
    "101. “Oh my Providence. You did bestow on me the Empire and taught me diagnosing of dreams. Oh Creator of Heavens and earth, You are my Lord in the World and Eternity, le me die in supplication to You and raise me with the virtuous.”",
    "102. This is the history of the past which We have revealed unto you, you were not present then when they had gathered to intrigue against Joseph.",
    "103. And most would not believe if you desire them.",
    "104. And you are not asking any reward from them, it is nothing but an advice to the world at large.",
    "105. And how many heavenly and earthly signs they come across and are indifferent to them.",
    "106. And most do not believe in God sincerely but association (partly).",
    "107. Are they safe against punishment coming suddenly or the Day of Judgment taking them unawares?",
    "108. Say, this is my way to God on which I tread and along with those who follow me.",
    "109. And before that We did not send any but a man of their town and revealed unto him, “Do they not walk on Earth and see what has happened to those who preceded them?” And the home of the (final) destination is better for the virtuous. Do you not understand so much?",
    "110. Until they (prophets) became despondent and felt sure of being falsified when We helped them and saved them, whom We liked and none can divert Our punishment from the culprit (infidels).",
    "111. Verily, in their history is a warning to the wise. It is not a story which can be falsified, but a fact of the past, which will clearly state and offer guidance and mercy to the faithful."

He sends rain from the clouds, in due proportion, which runs into streams carrying refuse, floating over it, setting the heavy particles at the bottom, like precious minerals, and ores which are roasted into fire, to extract valuable metal for ornaments, throwing away the suspended impurity, thus utilizing profitable products and clarifies God, thus exemplifying truth and falsity.",

Those who obey God’s Commands by avoiding illicit have paradise for them and others who deny them even though they shall offer all what is on earth with extra of the same quantity towards compensation to their disobedience on Reckoning day, it shall not be accepted and they shall have an intense punishment and their destination is hell, which is an awful abode.",

    "25. And those who breached the covenant after having covenanted and litigated with those whom God has commanded to make peace and plot sedition against them on Earth. These are the people on whom is curse and for whom is hell.",
    "26. God expands provision on whom He likes and contracts likewise. Former are pleased with the transitory wealth of the world which is, as compared to eternity, trifling.",
    "27. And the infidels ask, “Why has no miracle come to him from his Providence?” Say, “Verily God leaves him in misguidance that He likes and guides him whom He directs to Himself.”",
    "28. Those who believe in God have their hearts attuned to Divine remembrance are content. Beware with Divine remembrance, hearts are content.",
    "29. Those who believe and act righteously have pleasing and happy destination.",
    "30. Thus We sent Prophets to preceding generations, so you may read out what is revealed unto you, although they are denying God. Say, “It is He, my Providence, and none else except Him, I trust in Him, and to Him shall I revert.”",
    "31. If there was any text with which mountains could be moved or earth torn open or the dead enlivened and talked with, this is the very text. Rather, God’s nominees, i.e. Divine Lights, have got entire control to will what they like (as their will is Divine Will). What! Are the faithful disappointed (in seeing everybody is not faithful)! If God wished, He would have guided all, but now as it is, the infidels will be coming across, warnings or getting close to them in their vicinity to realize evidence of His existence until Day of Judgment and verily God does not contradict His promise.",
    "32. Verily, before you, other prophets were also laughed at, and We relaxed the infidels and then seized them on their persistence therein without penance. How sever was the punishment!",
    "33. Can He Who watches actions of all, be like him, who cannot? And they nominated His associates, tell them to name them or do they give you information, regarding those gods, whom God does not known on Earth? Or are they expressing what comes into their heads? Rather, their intrigue has gained a fancy in their eyes and they are barring men from following His path, and him, whom God forsakes, none can guide.",
    "34. For them is punishment in this world and of Eternity is worse, and there will be nobody to save them from Divine punishment.",
    "35. Can the paradise promised to the pious be the same as otherwise (Hell?) and flow beneath wherein streams and wherein shall they ever eat their fruits and lie beneath the shade. This is the Eternity promised to the virtuous and for the infidels is hell.",
    "36. Those whom We have sent the Text are pleased with it, and the group denies a part of it say, “I am commanded to worship God without associating any with Him. Him I call (for assistance) and to Him shall I revert.”",
    "37. And thus We revealed Our commands in Arabic, and if you follow their passions, after the knowledge having come to you, there will be none to sympathize and save you from God.",
    "38. Verily We sent prophets before you who had wives and children and it is not for a prophet to bring a miracle without God’s permission and for everything there is a pre-recorded decision.",
    "39. God wipes out what He likes, and retains what He wills, and before Him is a mighty record.",
    "40. And whether We were to show you punishment what We have promised for them, or We call you back to Us, for you it is to communicate the mission and for Us is to exact the account.",
    "41. Did they not see how We are contracting surface about them? (Reducing learned men and peace lovers) and God shall command which will not be controverted and He is quick at accounting.",
    "42. And they intrigued against God, Who has complete control over their intrigue. He is acquainted with everybody’s planning and shortly shall infidels see what is their eternal home.",
    "43. And the infidels said, “You are not a prophet.” Say, “God is sufficient to witness it between you and I and the one who has got the complete knowledge of the Text to boot"

Fire whereof, if it begins to smoulder, shall be reignited.",
    "98. This will be punishment for them, who have refused to accept rule of Divine Lights, and said, “What! When we shall become bones, shall be raised alive again?”",
    "99. Did they not understand God, Who created the Heavens and Earth, can create again what He has created once? And He has fixed periods for them wherein there is no doubt and these infidels will certainly refuse.",
    "100. You say, “If you had possession of Divine mercy, you would have, out of fear, acted miserly,” and man is a great miser.",
    "101. And certainly We had endowed upon Moses nine miracles: locusts, lice, blood, frogs, flood, crossing of the Red Sea, gushing of water from stones, rod becoming a serpent, and shining hand. As the Bani Israel when Moses put them forth (the above miracles) Pharaoh said, “In my opinion, you have been bewitched.”",
    "102. Moses said, “You know none has sent these miracles except the Providence of the Heavens and Earth with proofs, and I think, verily, you are doomed.”",
    "103. Then Pharaoh though of banishing Moses from his state, so We drowned Pharaoh and those with him.",
    "104. Then we commanded Bani Israel to occupy the lands of the drowned and when Our promise of reckoning Day shall be fulfilled, We shall assemble you all.",
    "105. And We have revealed this (Qur’an) with truth, and It has come with Truth Both Divine Lights and We have not sent you a messenger except as a tidings giver and a warner.",
    "106. And We have revealed the Glorious Qur’an piecemeal, so you may read it out to them (similarly) and We revealed it, as it was deemed to be revealed.",
    "107. Say, “Believe in it or not those, verily who have been endowed with Divine knowledge, when it is read out to them, fall in prostration.",
    "108. And say, “Pure is Thy nature, oh our Providence. Verily the promise of our Providence shall be fulfilled.”",
    "109. And they fall down, weeping, which enhances their devotion.",
    "110. Say, “Pray unto Him, call Him God or Compassionate, with whatever attribute you choose, all Glorious attributes are his, and you, in your prayers, do not raise your voice loudly, nor say in a whispering tone, but in between.",
    "111. And say, “All praise is due to God, Who has neither adopted a son nor taken a partner for His Kingdom being not need of anyone to support Him and you go on glorifying Him in the highest terms.”"

    "1. Praise be to God, Who revealed the Text fair and straight to His creature, wherein, He did not leave any drawback",
    "2. with which to warn of an intense punishment from Him, giving tidings to the faithful who act righteously of a food reward (Paradise)",
    "3. wherein shall they ever reside",
    "4. and to warn infidel Quraish, for their statement who attribute an issue to God.",
    "5. Neither have they any knowledge, nor their forefathers: a serious statement issuing out of their mouth, which is an absolute lie.",
    "6. Are you, oh Prophet, going to give up your life in grief if they are not going to put faith in this Glorious Qur’an?",
    "7. Verily have We adorned everything on Earth (which is frail) to try who acts amongst you righteously (for Eternity).",
    "8. And certainly, shall We, whatever it is on it, render a barren ground.",
    "9. Do you think that sleepers in the cave, and the plates were Our major signs?",
    "10. When these faithful men were going to the cave, they prayed, “Oh our Providence, endow on us, out of Thy mercy, and grant us source of our guidance.”",
    "11. We struck on their ears, whereby they could not hear (i.e. made them sleep) in the cave for a definite period.",
    "12. Then We raised them to find out which amongst the two different groups (faithful and the faithless) had arrived at the correct period of their stay therein.",
    "13. We are going to relate their history correctly. They were such a group of men, who had believed in their Providence and We befitted them to remain steady in their faith.",
    "14. And confirmed their belief, in their hearts, when they firmly asserted their Providence is the Creator of the Heavens and Earth (when they found themselves out of danger). Until then, they safeguarded themselves by an apparent association, on getting an opportunity, they said, “We shall never call any other Providence, from hence, and in case of such a statement, we shall be liable.”",
    "15. This tribe of Ours, barring God, has adopted many gods. Why did they not, in defence thereof, produce any argument? Who can be a greater tyrant than one falsifying God?",
    "16. Now when you are out of danger from them, do not pray sincerely any except God. Let us go across (the country), our Providence, out of His Grace, shall extend it and devise means to facilitate our affairs.",
    "17. You will the sun rising a little to their right and when it sets, it passes to their left and they are lying in a ventilable space, which is one of the Divine signs. Whom God guides is guided, and admitted to Paradise, and whomever He forsakes, you do not find for him any sympathizer (a) or guide.",
    "18. You will deem them awake, although they are asleep, and We are turning them to the right and to the left and their dog, lying on the threshold, has spread his front legs. If you happen to see them, you will take to your heels, turning away from them being frightened about their surroundings.",
    "19. And so We raised them, then they began to discourse among themselves. One of them asked, “How long did you stay here?” One of them said, “A day or a part of it.” They said, “Your Providence knows better on your stay. Better go, one of you with a coin to town and see what pure food is available to bring for us to eat, but should not speak anything more or inform any of them about our stay here.",
    "20. “IF they overpower you, they will stone you to death or force you to revert to their faith, they you will never attain salvation.”",
    "21. And thus We acquainted the people of the State, so they may be convinced of the Truth of Divine Promise and the Reckoning Day is bound to follow wherein there is no doubt when they were litigating among themselves about them (as to their actual faith), the decided to raise a monument over there, leaving to their providence about their actual tenets. Who knows better about them, and those, who had the power in their hands said, “They would build a mosque over there.",
    "22. Shortly will they guess them to be three with fourth as their dog. Others say five with the sixth as their dog. Talking at random and others, saying seven and eighth is their dog. Say, “My Providence is better acquainted with the actual number.” Nobody knows except a few. You had better not dispute about them except what is revealed unto you and do not ask any of them in this connection.",
    "23. And never say, “I shall do tomorrow anything,” unless under condition of Divine Will.",
    "24. And remember your Providence (by laying a condition on recollection) when once you have forgotten to say so, and say, “Shall God grant me superior signs than relating this history, in confirmation of being a genuine Prophet.”",
    "25. They say, “They lived in the caves for 309 years.”",
    "26. Say, “God knows better how long they stayed. With Him is the secret of the Heavens and the Earth. What a mighty Seer and a mighty Hearer is He.” Barring Him there is none for them as Lord and He does not participate with self, anyone, in His commands.",
    "27. Read out to them what is revealed unto you from your Providence of the Text. There is none to contradict or face Commands and you shall never find anyone, barring Him, any refuge against Him.",
    "28. And bear patiently with those who pray to their Providence day and night and are desirous of seeking His Will and do not turn them out from you with a view to seeking worldly adornment and do not follow passion and their affairs have transgressed.",
    "29. Say, “Truth has come to you from your Providence. He, who may like, put faith in it and he who dislikes, may disbelieve it.” Verily have We prepared fire of Hell for the tyrants, curtains whereof shall envelope them, and if they complain of thirst, they will be given molten copper instead of water, which will fry up their face. What an awful drink it is and what an awful abode to live in.",
    "30. Verily those who have put faith and acted righteously, certainly shall We not void the reward of their virtuous deeds.",
    "31. These are the people for whom are paradises of highest grades, below which flow streams and who will be ornamented with gold necklaces and dressed in green sarcenet velvet silk suits, seated on sofas, with pillows behind. What a happy reward and a fine place to stay in.",
    "32. Relate to them history of those two men, for one of whom We had arrayed two gardens of grapes and surround them the date trees and in the middle had arranged fields as well.",
    "33. These two gardens used to yield abundant fruits, without causing any loss and in between these two gardens, We had run a stream as well.",
    "34. He had a lot of property as well, and in conversation with his neighbour, prided he was superior to him from both points of view of property and family.",
    "35. And he reached his garden in such a manner in which he was ungrateful and ruining himself (thereby), and said, “I never imagine these gardens would ever be destroyed.",
    "36. “Nor do I think it will ever be Judgment Day come into being and even if I were to revert to my Providence, I shall be better posted than my present state in this world.”",
    "37. When his companion, in reply said, “What, do you deny His existence Who created you out of Earth then through sperm, then turned you out into a good looking man?",
    "38. “As regards to me, my God is my Providence with Whom I do not associate any.",
    "39. “And why did you not say while entering your garden, ‘What God willed would happen,’ as per Divine decree, which none has power to change except God, though I am compared with your property and family, quite inferior to you.",
    "40. “My Providence, in future, may endow on me a better garden than yours and can cast from the heavens, on your garden, a catastrophe, converting it into level barren plot.",
    "41. “Or waters of channels of your garden may do down so deep as to render you unable to draw them.”",
    "42. So, fire from heaven poured down rendering him penitent for the loss he sustained. The grape-creepers fell down and he went on Crying, “Would I had not associated any with my Providence.”",
    "43. There is none to help me except God and none could stop the Divine catastrophe.",
    "44. On Dooms day, sole sovereignty will be of God alone, Who, by virtue of rewarding and appreciating His creatures obedience, is much to be desired.",
    "45. Exemplify worldly life is like water which We pour down from the clouds with which gets mixed with vegetation and sod, and on withdrawal thereof dries up to powder and is carried away by wind, and God is Omnipotent over all.",
    "46. Property and children are adornment of the world, whereas permanent virtues and superior near your Providence, both from the point of view of reward and hope",
    "47. And the day We shall move mountains, and you will see the soil exposed, and We shall so assemble you all. We shall leave nobody.",
    "48. And they will be produced, before your Providence, duly arrayed and then will be addressed, “You have come to Us as We created you first. Rather, you were under the impression We had not fixed any period for your reversion to Us.”",
    "49. And deed charts will be produced when “Oh you sinful” trembling at what is recorded therein, shall say, “Woe to us, what sort of chart is this? It has neither omitted a trifling thing nor a major one without recording it.” In short, they will find what they had committed and your Providence will not ill-treat anyone.",
    "50. Recall when We commanded angels to prostrate before Adam, they followed except (self-willed) Satan. He was of a sect of spirits. He disobeyed the commands of his Providence. “What, are you going to take him and his family, friends, barring Me although they (devils) are you enemies.” Bad is the reward for the disobedient.",
    "51. I did not make them a witness, during creation of the heavens and Earth, ad I did not make the misguided to reinforce Islam.",
    "52. And on this day, God shall Command, “Call your associates of Mine, as peer your views. they will call them, when they will give no reply to them and We shall throw across them a distinctive bar.",
    "53. And the criminals shall see fire of hell and be sure of being hurled into it and shall not find any escape therefrom.",
    "54. And verily We, for the benefit of man, have frequently given varying examples but he is highly litigating in almost every affair.",
    "55. When guidance from believing in him and praying forgiveness of their Providence, except the devastating law of the preceding generations should be exercised or the punishment should stare in their faces.",
    "56. We do not send Prophets but as Evangelists and Warners, and the infidels dispute, on false grounds, to overpower Truth, and they ridicule My Commands with which they are threatened.",
    "57. And who can be a greater tyrant than one who is being advised with Divine Couplets, he turns away therefrom, and forgets what his hand has perpetrated. Verily have We thrown curtains across their hearts so they do not understand, and made heavy their ears, and if you invite them to guidance, they will never submit to guidance.",
    "58. And your Providence is Mighty at forgiving and Merciful. Had He seized them for their deeds, He would have punished them soon. Rather, for them is a stipulated period as a result of the Test, until (Day of Judgment) whence they will not find any source.",
    "59. And these towns, whenever their residents sinned, We destroyed all and We have fixed a period for their condemnation to hell.",
    "60. Recall when Moses told his companion Joshua bin Noon, “I shall not return until I reach the confluence of the two seas or go on proceeding for years.”",
    "61. When they reached the confluence of the two seas they forgot their salted fish,",
    "62. when he went ahead, Moses told his companion to bring their meals, as they were tied with fatigue by travelling.",
    "63. Joshua said, Did you notice, when we reached the rock of the confluence, I forgot to take up the fish and it was the devil who made me forget it in which I should have kept in view and strangely it found its way to the sea.”",
    "64. Moses said, “That was the place we were in search of.” They went back tracing their footprints",
    "65. where they found a devotee of Our devotees on whom We had endowed grace from Us and granted him Divine Knowledge from Us.",
    "66. Moses requested from him “May I follow you to pick up (a part of) of the knowledge endowed on you?”",
    "67. Khizar said, “You will not be able to bear patience with me [because you decide on evident affairs].”",
    "68. “And how can you bear patience (on affairs) about which you are not informed.”",
    "69. Moses said, “If God willed, you will find me patient and I shall not disobey you therein.”",
    "70. (Khizar) said, “If you want to accompany me, do not ask me anything unless I myself relate to you thereabout.”",
    "71. Both of them started until they arrived at a boat, when Khizar bored a hole therein. Moses said, “Did you bore a hole with a view to drowning the inmates thereof? Verily this is an offensive act.”",
    "72. Khizar said, “Did not I tell you, you will have no patience with me?”",
    "73. Moses said, “Pray do not hold me up for what I forgot and be not so strict in my affairs.”",
    "74. Then they proceeded until they came upon a boy whom Khizar killed. Moses said, “Did you kill an innocent boy without charge of murder. Verily you have behaved quite astonishingly.”",
    "75. Khizar said, “Did I not tell you, you will not have patience me?”",
    "76. Moses said, “If after this, did I ask you, do not keep me in your company. I have pleaded enough excuses.",
    "77. They started, until they came to a village whom they asked to entertain them. They refused to do so. They came across a wall which was about to fail. When Khizar repaired it Moses said, “If you please, you can ask for wages (for your labour).”",
    "78. Khizar said, “This is enough cause for our parting. I shall advise you on affairs on which you could not bear patiently.",
    "79. “The boat belonged to the poor with which they earned livelihood (by rowing it). I thought of making it defective as onward was a king who was under force seizing every sound boat.",
    "80. “Regarding the boy I killed, he had faithful parents, so We were anxious the boy, due to transgression and infidelity may overpower them.",
    "81. “We decided to substitute him with a son, who may be granted to them by their Providence, faithful, kind in nature to them, too.",
    "82. “And the wall of the village belonged to two orphans underneath which were a treasure and the father of these two was a virtuous man. Your Providence decided, out of His Grace, they excavate it, on reaching maturity. I did not do it of my own accord. This is the reason of affairs on which you could not bear patience.”",
    "83. They ask about Alexander. Say, “I shall relate to you his history.”",
    "84. Verily, We had endowed on him kingdom on Earth and simultaneously had We granted him cause for everything.",
    "85. So he pursued one of them until he reached the horizon of the setting sun.",
    "86. When he found it setting in the black bossy stream, where he found an infidel tribe (worshipping the sun) when We addressed him, “It is at your discretion to punish them or oblige them.”",
    "87. Alexander said, “If anybody of you disobeyed me by worshipping the sun shall be punished.” When he reverted to his Providence, God shall punish him, too.",
    "88. And he who embraced faith and acted righteously shall be rewarded and We shall moderate Our Commands accordingly with regard to him.",
    "89. Then he pursued another cause.",
    "90. He reached the horizon of the rising sun, when he found a tribe who had no means to protect against the sun.",
    "91. And certainly We were acquainted with whatever was under his control.",
    "92. Then he pursued another cause.",
    "93. Until he reached between two hills where he found a tribe who did not understand any language.",
    "94. They addressed Alexander, “Verily Gog and Magog go on agitating here. We can spend money on your account to enable you to construct a bar between us and them.”",
    "95. Alexander said, “Whatever endowment by the Providence has granted me is more than enough. You had better help me in labour to enable me to construct a wall between you and them.",
    "96. “Get me iron sheets to fill the valley between the hills, then.” Then he ordered them to heat them to red head, then asked for copper (make an alloy).",
    "97. Then Gog and Magog would not climb or bore holes therein.",
    "98. Alexander said, “This is Divine Mercy from my Providence. When the period of promise my Providence will draw near He will throw down the wall and level it up and the Divine Promise will be fulfilled.",
    "99. And on that Day, We shall so liberate them, man and spirit, as waves shall overlap one another, and when the trumpet will blow, We shall assemble them all in one place.",
    "100. And We shall expose Hell on this day to the infidels",
    "101. before whose eyes are drawn up curtains (of enmity to Ali due to which they could not hear advice in the world of our Prophet).",
    "102. What! Do the infidels deem they shall, against My will, allure my devotees to their sympathy and intercession? Verily for the infidels We have prepared Hell as an entertainment.",
    "103. Say, “Shall I acquaint you, who shall be greatest sufferer, by virtue of their deeds?”",
    "104. They are those whose energy in the world was wasted while they have been entertaining they had been doing great work.",
    "105. These are the People who denied the Divine Lights in person as commands of their Providence and meeting Him. Thus their acts shall be voided (for want of true faith) so We shall not fix any test, wherewith, to judge them.",
    "106. The reward for them is Hell for their infidelity and having ridiculed My Commands.",
    "107. Verily those who embrace faith and acted righteously shall be entertained in Paradise and Firdaus.",
    "108. Where shall they ever abide and never desire to change.",
    "109. Say, “If the sea was turned into ink (record the attributes) for lights of my Providence before its completion, the ink would certainly finish, even if it was doubled in quantity.”",
    "110. Say, “Although I am a man like you and for which I receive revelation in which there is only one God, your Lord. He who seeks to Him should act righteously with sincerity, without associating any with Him.”"

Out of which came out a perfect creature or imperfect, which it may be evident to you.

You say, “Shall I inform you of the worse treatment than that, and that is fire which God has promised to the infidels, and which is a bad place for residence.”",
    "73. Oh you people, listen to an example being described to you. Of course, those who worship, barring God, cannot create even a fly, even if they gather together, and if they fly takes away anything from them, they cannot snatch it from it. Both the seeker and the sought are weak by themselves.",

    "19. So when he found Moses was about to beat him, he told Moses, “Do you want to kill me as you killed a man yesterday? Do you mean to act like a tyrant and have no intention to reconcile?”",
    "20. And thus came a man running from a distant end of the street and said, “Oh Moses, the officers have decided to kill you. Get away from here and I am your well-wisher.”",
    "21. And Moses ran and their praying to God to save him from the tyrants.",
    "22. So when Moses directed himself to Midian, he said to himself, “My God shall lead me to the right path.”",
    "23. When he arrived at the village well, he found a group of people feeding their animals with water and found two girls standing aloof holding up their sheep, preventing themselves from mixing up with the crowd. So he addressed them, “What about you?” They said, “We cannot feed out sheep until the crowd disperses and our father is aged.”",
    "24. So he fed their sheep with water and took himself aside under the shade of a tree, praying to God, “Whatever bounty You have reserved for me I beg of Your gift.”",
    "25. When one of those two girls approached him bashfully saying, “My father wants to reward you for your labour of feeding our animals with water.” So when he came to Shu‘ayb, he related his past history. When he (Shu‘ayb) said, “Be not afraid anymore, you are safe against tyrannical hands.”",
    "26. When one of them (the two daughters) said, “Oh Father, engage him on a stipend for verily he is strong and faithful thus deserving of employment.",
    "27. Shu‘ayb said, “I intend to marry one of my daughters to you, on condition of your serving me eight years, and if you complete ten, all the better, although I do not force you.” (Moses said), “God willing, you will find me among the virtuous (fulfilling the contract).”",
    "28. Then he said, “This is a closed contract between us two, on any period I fulfil there will be no pressure on me and God is a witness to our (verbal) contract.",
    "29. When Moses completed his stipulated period, he started with his wife (Sufera) when he saw fire from Mount Sinai. He told his wife to halt there, Verily I have seen fire whence I can bring news or burning charcoal with which you can warm yourself (as it is extremely cold tonight).”",
    "30. And when he reached the place he was shouted out from the right side of the valley of the sacred Mount Sinai from a burning bush, “Oh Moses, I am God the providence of the worlds.",
    "31. “And you had better cast down your rod.” When he saw it moving like a living serpent, he turned his back and took to heels without looking behind. When he was shouted again by Divine call, “Oh Moses, come, do not be afraid. You are among the guarded (from the serpent and else).”",
    "32. “Take out your hand from pocket, shining, without any disease, and shrug your shoulders to remove your fright, and these two are miracles from your Providence, for Pharaoh and his nobles. Verily they are a disobedient tribe.”",
    "33. Moses said, “Oh my Providence, I have killed a man and I fear I shall be killed (in turn).",
    "34. “And my brother Aaron is more fluent than I, send him with me to assist to testify me as I fear I shall be falsified otherwise.”",
    "35. God said, “Shortly shall I strengthen your shoulder with your brother, granting you a miracle on account of which they will not approach you two and your followers, (too), shall succeed with our miracles.”",
    "36. When Moses came to them with Our open miracles, they said, “This is nothing but magic (libelling God), and we have never heard about it from our preceding forefathers.”",
    "37. Moses said, “My God knows I have come with guidance from Him and he know who is fated for (Paradise in) eternity, and the disobedient will not be spared.”",
    "38. Pharaoh said, “Oh my nobles, I have not known any other God except myself. So you kindle a fire, oh you Haman, to bake bricks and make a (lofty tower) to ascend to meet Moses’ God. Verily I believe him to be of the liars.”",
    "39. Thus he and they (his forces) prided without rhyme and reason and thought they would not revert to Us.",
    "40. So We seized him and his forces and drowned them in the sea. See what has been the fate of the disobedient.",
    "41. And We have made them leaders inviting to Hell, and on Reckoning Day, they will not be helped.",
    "42. And We have deprecated curse on them in this world and on the Day of Judgment shall they be among the (worst sufferers).",
    "43. Verily We gave Moses a Text, after having destroyed preceding generation (clearly) testifying to man as guidance and mercy so they may take an advice.",
    "44. And you (oh Prophet) were not to the West (or near Mount Sinai) when We decided Moses’ affairs not did you witness it.",
    "45. But We created generations and a long period intervened between them, and you were not stopping with men of Midian when you could read out to them Our Text but We were to send in you a messenger.",
    "46. And you were not on Mount Sinai when We shouted out to Moses (knowledge thereof is) a mercy from your Providence, to war the generation to whom they (warners) had not come so far, so they may take advice.",
    "47. Lest, when calamity befall them on account of their own misdeeds, they may say, “Oh Providence, why didst You not sent us Prophets, we would have followed them and become faithful.”",
    "48. And when the truth (in person of the Prophet) came to them from us, they said, “Why are you not given miracles, like those of Moses?” Did they not refuse the Text given to Moses before you? They said, “These two are open magicians and refused to accept each of the entirely (as Divine Messengers).",
    "49. Say, “Bring a Book from God better in guidance than (Torah and Qur’an, they have received) so I shall follow it if you are true.”",
    "50. And if they do not answer you then know they are passionate (in their actions) and who can be more misguided than one who follows one’s passion without guidance from God? And verily God does not guide a disobedient community.",
    "51. And certainly We have made the word to reach them so that they may be mindful.",
    "52. And certainly We have made the word to reach them so that they may be mindful.",
    "53. And when (Our) Couplets are being read out to them, they say, “We have embraced faith i the Text (Qur’an).” It is a genuine revelation from our Providence, and verily we are supplicant to (the text).",
    "54. Those are the people who shall be doubly rewarded for their patience in have substituted the ills (done to them) by virtues and in having spent out of what We have provided, in the name of God.",
    "55. When they hear non-sense they turn away their faces, saying “To us is the reward of our actions and likewise to you for your acts, peace be upon you, we are not fond of ignorant society.”",
    "56. Verily you cannot guide whom you like. Rather, God guides whom He likes, and He is acquainted with those capable of being guided.",
    "57. And they say, “If we follow you we shall be swept away from Earth.” What! Have We not made a holy sanctuary, safe against invasions of infidels? Providing it with provisions from Earth? But most do not know it",
    "58. And how many have We destroyed of the cities which were (vainly) prosperous? these houses have not since flourished except a few, and We are the final inheritors of all.",
    "59. And your Providence is not going to destroy until He raises a Prophet amongst them, who reads out to them Our (Divine) Commandments, and We shall never destroy any city except when the residents thereof become disobedient.",
    "60. And whatever We have given you is the transitory property of this world and which is its decoration (liable to decay) and what is with God is far better and permanent. You cannot understand so much?",
    "61. What! Is he whom We have promised (Eternal Bliss) and it is good and sure to be fulfilled is alike one whom We have granted of worldly property? And for which he will be presented before God to render account on the day of Judgment.",
    "62. When they will be called upon (at the instance of God) to produce their associates (with Me).",
    "63. And they on whom Our punishment will be justified will cry out, “Oh our Providence, these are the people whom we misguided as we ourselves were misguided.” The misguided leaders will say, “We seek separation from them and come to You.” They were not really worshipping Us but were slaves to their passion in gaining this world.",
    "64. And they will be asked to call out their associates, upon which they will call them, and they will not reply to them, and when they shall see the punishment they will wish they had been rightly guided.",
    "65. And, on that day, regarding the Prophet, they will be asked how they replied to his invitation (to God).",
    "66. And on that day they will not be able to reply and will not be able to question one another.",
    "67. But he, of course, who did penance, embraced faith, had acted virtuously, it is likely (certainly being God’s promise) he will attain salvation.",
    "68. And your Providence creates what He likes and chooses a Prophet whom He likes. Others have no hand in it. Pure is He from what they associate others with Him.",
    "69. And your Providence knows what you hide in your heart and expose",
    "70. and it is He, God and there is none except Him. And for Him alone is praise both in this world and eternity. His will be done; to Him shall you all revert.",
    "71. Say, “Will you note if He continues the night until the Day of Judgment. Is there any of you who can bring day (light) instead. Do you not listen (carefully).”",
    "72. Say, “Do you note if God continues the day, until the Day of Judgment, which god except Him can bring night for you to rest. Do you not understand it?”",
    "73. And out of His grace, He made (alternately) night and day, so you may take rest (during the night) and work for living (during the day), out of His grace and be grateful to Him.",
    "74. And on the Day of Judgment, they will be called upon to produce their associates of whose intercession they were sure on their behalf.",
    "75. And We shall produce for every generation a witness in Divine Light of his age and shall ask them to produce proofs of their following their own religion (against his invitation) and when they will realize the truth is with God and what false charges they were adducing shall all disappear.",
    "76. Verily Karun was a member of Moses’ community, then he transgressed and We had given him so much wealth that the keys of his treasures were difficult to be carried by a group of strong men. When his sect told him not to strut (in vain glory) as God does not like the vain.",
    "77. Obey and seek eternity with what God has endowed on you and do not forget your share (of health, wealth, time, energy, all being Divine Deposit to be voted to God) in the world, and oblige others as God has obliged you and do not fan sedition (on earth). Verily God does not like the seditious.",
    "78. He said, “What is granted to me is due to my own knowledge.” What he did not know, verily God destroyed many a generation before him, who was stronger than him, both in might and main? And the culprits will not be questioned about their sins (they will be hurled right into hell).",
    "79. And so he started coming out in public, amongst his sect, with (affected) pomp and dignity.",
    "80. And those (of Moses’ adherents) who were give (Divine) knowledge said, “You be damned.” Those who embraced faith and acted virtuously have a much greater Divine reward and this fact is not appreciated except by the (few) patient (faithful).",
    "81. Then We buried Karoon and his wealth and his treasures into the earth and he had none of his group to help him against God nor could he save himself.",
    "82. And those who had wished themselves to be alike (Karoon) said, “It is only God Who expands provision on His creatures as He likes and contracts on whom He chooses. Had not God obliged us (by keeping our provisions contacted) we would have been likewise buried.” Alas! Only the infidels cannot find shelter.",
    "83. House of Eternity, we have reserved for those who do not want to be (vainly) proud and seditious on Earth. Rather, Eternity is for the pious.",
    "84. Whoever brings good, he shall have better than it, and whoever brings evil, those who do evil shall not be rewarded (for) aught except what they did.",
    "85. Verily He who has revealed unto you the Text (for transmission) shall raise you during in due dispense of justice. Say, “My Providence knows who is on guidance and who is suffering under open misguidance.”",
    "86. You did not expect revelation of the Book, but it was a mercy from your Providence, so side not with infidels.",
    "87. Lest they may turn you away from Divine Commands, after revelation having come to you, and be not among the associators.",
    "88. And do not associate any with God. There is no other god but He. Everything is destructible, except His Kingdom for Him is the final judgment to Whom shall you revert."

    "4. And when you defy an infidel, slay him, when you capture him until he is bled to death or handcuff him and if he surrenders, the Divine Light may set him free or demand a ransom or make him a slave.

    "36. Wildly life is nothing but play and sport, whereas if you believe and fear God, God will give you the reward and will not demand all of your property.",
    "37. And if He demands, under insistence, the whole of it, and if you act in hesitation miserly (as those who departed Hussain at Karbala) He would expose your weakness.",
    "38. These are the people who are asked to spend in the name of God. Those who are miserly, consequence thereof is on the one who so acts, and God is Self-sufficient and you are dependent upon Him. So if you turn away, He will replace you by another nation (Persians) who will not so act as you do."
